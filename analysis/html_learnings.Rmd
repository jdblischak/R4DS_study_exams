The web was built to allow humans to share content even though our computers are different from each other.

This is made possible by 3 different programming languages each doing a part of the job.


<h2>HTML</h2>

HTML marks up the content of a site. 

- It tells the users computer what things are.
- It gives access to built in functionality of the browser that you can harness as a developer.
- Its all declarations.
- HTML can take a lot of abuse but still work.


## CSS

CSS stands for `Cascading Style Sheets` 

- Provides visual styling and layout for everything on a web page.
- Makes each page look the way it looks - colour, typography and size. 
- Can add simple interactions and animations through CSS.
- If something goes wrong in CSS the browser will skip just that section of code and not apply that styling, but it will apply all the rest.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that provides the ability to create more powerful interactivity.

- Most powerful
- Used to make more interactive sites
- Also most fragile - if something goes wrong / browser too old to know what the code means the browser will stop. It gives up. It does not guess what to do.
