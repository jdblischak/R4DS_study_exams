<h2>Vector Basics</h2>
## Vector Basics

There are two types of vectors:

1. __Atomic__ vectors, of which there are different types:
  __logical__, __integer__, __double__,  __character__, __complex__, and 
  __raw__. 
1. __Lists__,  which are sometimes called recursive vectors because lists can 
  contain other lists. 

`NULL` is often used to represent the absence of a vector (a vector 
of length 0) (as opposed to `NA` which is used to represent the absence of a 
value in a vector). 


Every vector has two key properties: 

1.  Its __type__, which you can determine with `typeof()` / `class`.

    ```{r}
    typeof(letters)
    class(letters)
    typeof(1:10)
    class(1:10)
    ```

1. Its __length__, which you can determine with `length()`.

    ```{r}
    (x <- list("a", "b", 1:10))
    length(x)
    typeof(x)
    class(x)
    ```

#### Logical

```{r}
1:10 %% 3 == 0
c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA)
typeof(1:10 %% 3 == 0)
length(1:10 %% 3 == 0)
```

#### Numeric

```{r, warning = TRUE}
typeof(1)
# sees this as integer - maybe because of the list of values, it can infer
# type better?
typeof(1:10) 
typeof(1L) # the L specifically changes it to an integer
typeof(1.5L)
typeof(1L:10L)
1L:10L
```

Doubles are <span style="color: #FFE4E1;background-color:#FD5800">approximations!</span>

```{r}
(x <- sqrt(2) ^ 2)
x - 2
```

Integers have one special value: `NA`, while <span style="color: #FFE4E1;background-color:#FD5800">doubles have four</span>:
<span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`NA`, 
`NaN`, `Inf` and `-Inf`</span>.

```{r}
c(-1, 0, 1) / 0
```

Avoid using `==` to check for these other special values. Instead use the 
helper functions `is.finite()`, `is.infinite()`, and `is.nan()`:
  
  |                  |  0  | Inf | NA  | NaN |
  |------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
  | `is.finite()`    |  x  |     |     |     |
  | `is.infinite()`  |     |  x  |     |     |
  | `is.na()`        |     |     |  x  |  x  |
  | `is.nan()`       |     |     |     |  x  |

#### Character

R uses a global string pool. This means that each unique string is only stored 
in memory once.

```{r}
x <- "This is a reasonably long string"
pryr::object_size(x)
y <- rep(x, 1000)
pryr::object_size(y)
# 8 byte pointers x 1000 to a 152B string
# I am not exactly getting to the same amt but it's close
# the bytes that make a kB is either 1000 or 1024
# I get close if I use the calc below BUT that is completely
# NOT consistent so I am probably incorrect here!!
(8*1000)/1000 + 152/1024
```

#### Missing values

Each type of _atomic vector_ has its own missing value.

```{r}
NA            # logical
NA_integer_   # integer
NA_real_      # double
NA_character_ # character
```

### Exercises

1.  Describe the difference between `is.finite(x)` and  `!is.infinite(x)`.

    - `is.finite(x)` tests if each element in the vector is finite.
    - `is.infinite(x)` tests if each element in the vector is `Inf` / `-Inf`.
    The `!` in front of `is.infinite(x)` asks each element of the vector -
    "Are you NOT Inf / -Inf?".
    
        * Hey -1/0 are you NOT Inf/-Inf? To which -1/0 replies FALSE,
        I am indeed -Inf!
        * Hey 0/0 are you NOT Inf/-Inf? To which 0/0 replies TRUE,
        I am not Inf/-Inf I am NaN!
        * Hey 1/0 are you NOT Inf/-Inf? To which 1/0 replies FALSE,
        I am indeed Inf!
        
    Help Page: <br>
    
    is.finite returns a vector of the same length as x the jth element of 
    which is TRUE if x[j] is finite (i.e., it is not one of the values 
    NA, NaN, Inf or -Inf) and FALSE otherwise. Complex numbers are finite 
    if both the real and imaginary parts are.

    is.infinite returns a vector of the same length as x the jth element of 
    which is TRUE if x[j] is infinite (i.e., equal to one of Inf or -Inf) 
    and FALSE otherwise.
    

    ```{r}
    is.finite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
    !is.infinite(c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
    ```


1.  Read the source code for `dplyr::near()` (Hint: to see the source code,
    drop the `()`). How does it work? 
    
    ```{r}
    dplyr::near
    ```

    It checks if two numbers are close to each other within some 
    tolerance `tol`.
    
    ```{r}
    dplyr::near(1, 1.1)
    dplyr::near(1, 1.1, tol = 0.11)
    dplyr::near(sqrt(2)^2, 2)
    dplyr::near(4, 4 + 4.567342e-10)
    ```
    
    

1.  A logical vector can take 3 possible values. How many possible
    values can an integer vector take? How many possible values can
    a double take? Use google to do some research.
    
    From the help page ?`integer`: The range of representable integers is 
    restricted to about +/-2*10^9.
    
    For doubles it is a bit more complicated to explain. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
    is more information.
    

1.  Brainstorm at least four functions that allow you to convert a double to an
    integer. How do they differ? Be precise.
    
    Depending on the function used some of these drop the decimal part and
    just keep the integer part, other functions convert the double
    to the nearest integer.
    
    ```{r}
    as.integer(2.678)
    2.678 %/% 1
    round(2.678, 0)
    floor(2.678)
    ceiling(2.678)
    trunc(2.678)
    ```
    
    
1.  What functions from the readr package allow you to turn a string
    into logical, integer, and double vector?
    
    The different `parse_` variants.

    ```{r, warning = TRUE}
    readr::parse_integer(c("1", "2"))
    readr::parse_double(c("2.45", "6.79"))
    readr::parse_logical(c("TRUE", "FALSE", "NA", "1", "0", "3"))
    ```

<h2>Using atomic vectors</h2>
## Using atomic vectors

### Coercion

You can coerce in two ways.

1. Explicitly using `as.logical()`, `as.integer()`, `as.double()`, 
or `as.character()`. But before explicitly coercing see if you can make 
the fix upstream, e.g. in your readr `col_types` specification.

1. Implicitly when you use a vector in a specific context, e.g. when you use 
a logical vector with in sum for example the TRUE and FALSE are converted
to 1 / 0 and added up.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- sample(20, # sample from 1:20
                100, # get me a 100 of those
                replace = TRUE # repeats are welcome
                )
    y <-  x > 10
    sum(y) # how many greater than 10?
    mean(y) # what proportion are greater than 10?
    ```

When you try and create a vector containing multiple types with `c()`, the most 
complex type always wins.

```{r}
typeof(c(TRUE, 1L)) # most complex type = integer
typeof(c(1L, 1.5)) # most complex type = double
typeof(c(1.5, "a")) # I can't convert "a" to a double, so 1.5 converted to char
```

An atomic vector can not have a mix of different types because the type is a 
<span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">property of the complete vector</span>,
__NOT__ <span style="color: #FFE4E1;background-color:#FD5800">the individual elements</span>.

### Test functions

Sometimes you want to do different things based on the type of vector and you may use
Base R's, `typeof()`,`is.vector()` etc. BUT these often return surprising 
results. <br>
{purr}'s `is_*` functions provide a good alternative.

|                  | lgl | int | dbl | chr | list |
|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|
| `is_logical()`   |  x  |     |     |     |      |
| `is_integer()`   |     |  x  |     |     |      |
| `is_double()`    |     |     |  x  |     |      |
| `is_numeric()`   |     |  x  |  x  |     |      |
| `is_character()` |     |     |     |  x  |      |
| `is_atomic()`    |  x  |  x  |  x  |  x  |      |
| `is_list()`      |     |     |     |     |  x   |
| `is_vector()`    |  x  |  x  |  x  |  x  |  x   |

### Scalars and recycling rules

R will also implicitly coerce the length of vectors by __recycling__, 
i.e. the shorter vector is repeated to the same length as the longer vector. 

Generally this is useful when you are mixing vectors and "scalars" (a single 
number is a vector of length 1).

```{r}
sample(10) + 100
runif(10) > 0.5
```

```{r}
# this is essentially as follows
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  +
# 1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2 
# -------------------------------
# 2  4  4  6  6  8  8  10  10 12
# the shorter vector (1,2) is recycled as many times as needed
1:10 + 1:2 
```

The `recycling` is silent except when the length of the longer is not an 
integer multiple of the length of the shorter vector.

```{r, warning = TRUE}
1:10 + 1:3
```

In tidyverse you will get errors when you recycle anything other than a "scalar"
(length 1 vector). To recycle, you need to do it yourself with `rep()`.

```{r, error = TRUE}
tibble(x = 1:4, y = 1:2)
tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, 2))
tibble(x = 1:4, y = rep(1:2, each = 2))
```

### Naming vectors

You may name your vector items during creation with `c()`.

```{r}
c(x = 1, y = 2, z = 4)
```

Or use `purrr::set_names()`:

```{r}
set_names(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```


### Subsetting

To subset a vector use `[`. `[` is the subsetting function.

- Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:

    ```{r}
    x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
    x[c(3, 2, 5)]
    ```
    
    Can also get longer output by repeating.
  
    ```{r}
    x[c(1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 2)]
    ```
    
- Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions.
    
    ```{r}
    x[c(-1, -3, -5)]
    ```
    
    It's an error to mix positive and negative values.
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    x[c(1, -1)]
    ```

- The error message mentions subsetting with zero, which returns no values.
    
    ```{r}
    x[0]
    ```

- Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a
    `TRUE` value. We use this often.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- c(10, 3, NA, 5, 8, 1, NA)
    
    # All non-missing values of x
    x[!is.na(x)]
    
    # All even (or missing!) values of x
    x[x %% 2 == 0]
    ```

- If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:
    
    ```{r}
    x <- c(abc = 1, def = 2, xyz = 5)
    x[c("xyz", "def")]
    x[c("xyz", "xyz", "abc", "abc")]
    ```
    

- The simplest type of subsetting is nothing, `x[]`, which returns the 
    complete `x`. Not useful for subsetting vectors, but useful
    when subsetting matrices E.g if `x` is 2d, `x[1, ]` selects the first row and 
    all the columns, and `x[, -1]` selects all rows and all columns except
    the first.
    
- There is an important variation of `[` called `[[`. `[[` only ever extracts 
a single element, and always drops names.


### Exercises

1.  What does `mean(is.na(x))` tell you about a vector `x`? What about
    `sum(!is.finite(x))`?
    
    - `mean(is.na(x))` tells you the proportion that is NA
    - `sum(!is.finite(x))` tells you how many non-finite entries
    are in your data
    
    ```{r}
    mean(is.na(c(NA, 2, TRUE, 4, NA, NaN, Inf, -Inf))) # 3/8
    sum(!is.finite(c(NA, Inf, 56, -Inf, 98.6, NaN)))
    ```
    
1.  Carefully read the documentation of `is.vector()`. What does it actually
    test for? Why does `is.atomic()` not agree with the definition of 
    atomic vectors above?
    
    - `is.atomic(x)` returns TRUE if the vector is any of the types ("logical", 
    "integer", "numeric", "complex", "character" and "raw") and NULL.
    - `is.vector(x)` returns TRUE if x is a vector with no attributes other 
    than `names`.

    ```{r}
    # borrowed from help page of ?is.atomic
    is_a_type <- function(x) c(vect = is.vector(x), atomic = is.atomic(x))
    is_a_type(c(a = 1, b = 3))
    is_a_type(list(2)) # why? class not one of those listed - i.e. it is a list
    is_a_type(list(2, 4, "test"))
    typeof(list(2))
    x <- list(2, 4, "test")
    attributes(x)
    ```
    
1.  Compare and contrast `setNames()` with `purrr::set_names()`.

    |     setNames()          | purrr::set_names      |
    |:-------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
    | two args, vector + vector of names            | three args, vector + vector of names + ...|
    | vector of names must be in c()                | vector of names can be in c() or individually specified|
    | NA                                            | Can be a function e.g. toupper |
    | If `nm` is NULL names removed                 | If `nm` is NULL names removed  |
    | If `nm` only specified, names match elements  | Error! Not allowed! x is mandatory |
    | If 1st arg only specified, error              | vector + names created out of 1st arg|
  
      ```{r, error = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
      purrr::set_names(1:4, c("a", "b", "c", "d"))
      purrr::set_names(1:4, letters[1:4])
      purrr::set_names(1:4, "a", "b", "c", "d")
      # If the second argument is omitted a vector is named with itself
      purrr::set_names(letters[1:5])
      # Alternatively you can supply a function
      purrr::set_names(1:10, ~ letters[seq_along(.)])
      purrr::set_names(head(mtcars), toupper)
      # If the input vector is unnamed, it is first named after itself
      # before the function is applied:
      purrr::set_names(letters, toupper)
      (mtcars_sub <- head(mtcars))
      purrr::set_names(mtcars_sub, nm = NULL)
      
      (tmp <- 1:3)
      (tmp <- setNames(tmp, c("foo", "bar", "baz")))
      (tmp <- setNames(tmp, NULL))
      (tmp <- setNames(nm=tmp))
      tmp <- setNames(tmp)
      ```
  

1.  Create functions that take a vector as input and returns:
    
    a. The last value.  Should you use `[` or `[[`?
    
      ```{r}
      last_val <- function(x){
        if(length(x) > 0) {
          x[[length(x)]]
        } else {
          x
        }
      }
      
      x <- 1:10
      last_val(x)
      x <- c()
      last_val(x)
      ```
    
    a. The elements at even numbered positions.
    
      ```{r}
      even_vals <- function(x){
        x[c(seq_along(x) %% 2 == 0)]
      }
      x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
      even_vals(x)
      x <- 1:10
      even_vals(x)
      ```
    
    
    a. Every element except the last value.
    
      ```{r}
      all_but_last_val <- function(x){
        if(length(x) > 0) {
          x[-length(x)]
        } else {
          "empty vector"
        }
      }
      
      x <- 1:10
      all_but_last_val(x)
      x <- c()
      all_but_last_val(x)
      all_but_last_val(c(10))
      ```
    
    a. Only even numbers (and no missing values).
    
      ```{r}
            even_nums <- function(x){
              if ((typeof(x) == "integer" || 
                   typeof(x) == "numeric" || 
                   typeof(x) == "double") 
                  && (length(x) > 0)) {
                x[(x %% 2 == 0) & (!is.na(x))]
              } else {
                "Not an integer vector!"
              }
            }
      x <- 1:10
      x[(x %% 2 == 0) & (!is.na(x))]
      even_nums(x)
      x <- c(NA, 1:5, NaN)
      even_nums(x)
      x <- letters[1:10]
      even_nums(x)
      ```
 
1.  Why is `x[-which(x > 0)]` not the same as `x[x <= 0]`? 

    - `which(x)`: "more generally, including when x has NA's, which(x) 
    is seq_along(x)[!is.na(x) & x]". This keeps track of the indicies 
    where the condition we're testing is TRUE. FALSE and NA are 
    ignored.
    - x <= 0 tests each to see which item meets criterion, and then marks
    those that do as TRUE, but NA / NaN values are NA for these.
    - Help page for ?`[`: "NAs in indexing: When extracting, a numerical, 
    logical or character NA index picks an unknown element and so returns 
    NA in the corresponding element of a logical, integer, numeric, complex 
    or character result, and NULL for a list."
    - So the NaN is the exception here, in that it is treated differently
    in each. In which(x) it was NA after the condition was checked, 
    so it is not what which(x) is looking for (recall which(x) only cares
    about TRUE), as a result it is ignored, but for `[]` it returns as NA.

    ```{r}
    x <- c(-9, NA, -Inf, 0:2, NaN, -12, 10, Inf)
    x[-which(x > 0)]
    which(x > 0)
    
    x[x <= 0]
    x<=0
    x[!(x <= 0)]
    ```

1.  What happens when you subset with a positive integer that's bigger
    than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a 
    name that doesn't exist?
    
    You get `NA`.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- 1:10
    v <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
    x[11]
    v["d"]
    ```
    

<h2>Lists (Recursive vectors)</h2>  
## Lists (Recursive vectors)

Lists are more complex than `vectors` as `lists` can contain other lists. 
You create a list with `list()`.

```{r}
x <- list(1, 2, 3)
x
x[1]
```

Super useful tool for working with lists is `str()` because it focusses on 
the **str**ucture, not the contents.

```{r}
str(x)
x_named <- list(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
str(x_named)
```

`list()` may have items of mixed types and other lists (not allowed in vectors).
```{r}
y <- list("a", 1L, 1.5, TRUE)
str(y)
```

```{r}
z <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(z)
```

```{r}
x1 <- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
str(x1)
x2 <- list(list(1, 2), list(3, 4))
str(x2)
x3 <- list(1, list(2, list(3)))
str(x3)
```

### Subsetting

There are three ways to subset a list:

```{r}
a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
str(a)
```

*   `[` extracts a sub-list. The result will always be a list.

    ```{r}
    str(a[1:2])
    str(a[4])
    a["a"]
    ```
    
*   `[[` extracts a single component from a list. It removes a level of 
    hierarchy from the list.

    ```{r}
    str(a[[1]])
    str(a[[4]])
    ```

*   `$` is a shorthand for extracting named elements of a list. It works
    similarly to `[[` except that you don't need to use quotes.
    
    ```{r}
    a$a
    a[["a"]]
    ```

`[[` drills down into the list while `[` returns a new, smaller list. 


### Exercises

1.  Draw the following lists as nested sets:

    a.  `list(a, b, list(c, d), list(e, f))`
    
    <img src="assets/list1.PNG" width="500" height="450" alt="answer exercise 1">
    
    a.  `list(list(list(list(list(list(a))))))`
    
    <img src="assets/list2.PNG" width="500" height="450" alt="answer exercise 1">

    ```{r}
    super_nested <- list(list(list(list(list(list(a = "a"))))))
    str(super_nested)
    ```

1.  What happens if you subset a tibble as if you're subsetting a list?
    What are the key differences between a list and a tibble?
    
    The subsetting is much the same - some cases the orientation of the returned
    structure is changed - e.g. column return for tibble `[` but row return
    for list `[`.
    
    The difference between a tibble and a list is that all the elements 
    of a tibble must be vectors with the same length (deals with
    `rectangular data`). A list works with rectangular and non-rectangular
    data.
    
    
    ```{r}
    x <- list(a = 1:10, b = letters[1:10])
    str(x)
    (x_tib <- tibble(a = 1:10, b = letters[1:10]))
    
    x[["a"]]
    x_tib[["a"]]
    x[2]
    x_tib[2]
    typeof(x[["a"]])
    typeof(x_tib[["a"]])
    typeof(x[2])
    typeof(x_tib[2])
    x$a
    x_tib$a
    ```

<h2>Attributes</h2>
## Attributes

Any vector can contain arbitrary additional metadata through its __attributes__. 
Attributes are a kind of named list of vectors that can be attached to an object. 
You can get and set individual attribute values with `attr()` or see them all at once with `attributes()`.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
attr(x, "greeting")
attr(x, "greeting") <- "Hi!"
attr(x, "farewell") <- "Bye!"
attributes(x)
```

```{r}
as.Date
```

You can list all the methods for a generic with `methods()`:

```{r}
methods("as.Date")
```

You can see the specific implementation of a method with `getS3method()`:

```{r}
getS3method("as.Date", "default")
getS3method("as.Date", "numeric")
```

One important S3 generic is `print()` as well as the subsetting functions
`[`, `[[`, and `$`. 

<h2>Augmented vectors</h2>
## Augmented vectors

There are some __augmented vectors__, which are vectors with additional
__attributes__:

* Factors
* Dates 
* Date-times
* Tibbles

### Factors

Factors are designed to represent categorical data that can take a fixed 
set of possible values. Factors are built on top of integers, 
and have a levels attribute:

```{r}
x <- factor(c("ab", "cd", "ab"), levels = c("ab", "cd", "ef"))
typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```

### Dates and date-times

Dates in R are numeric vectors that represent the number of days since 
1 January 1970.

```{r}
x <- as.Date("1971-01-01")
unclass(x)
typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```

Date-times are numeric vectors with class `POSIXct` that represent the number 
of seconds since 1 January 1970.

```{r}
x <- lubridate::ymd_hm("1970-01-01 01:00")
unclass(x)
typeof(x)
attributes(x)
```

The `tzone` attribute is optional. It controls how the time is printed.

```{r}
attr(x, "tzone") <- "US/Pacific"
x
attr(x, "tzone") <- "US/Eastern"
x
attr(x, "tzone") <- "Africa/Johannesburg"
x
```

You can always convert datetimes to a regular date time 
`lubridate::as_date_time()`.

### Tibbles

Tibbles are augmented lists: they have class "tbl_df" + "tbl" + "data.frame", 
and `names` (column) and `row.names` attributes:

```{r}
tb <- tibble::tibble(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(tb)
attributes(tb)
```

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 5:1)
typeof(df)
attributes(df)
```

The main difference is the class. 

### Exercises

1.  What does `hms::hms(3600)` return? How does it print? What primitive
    type is the augmented vector built on top of? What attributes does it 
    use?
    
    Time is stored in it. This is converting 3600 seconds to a time in the
    format hh:mm:ss hence `01:00:00` returned. Built on top of `difftime`. 
    It does not need any attibutes as all have defaults.
    
    ```{r}
    hms::hms(3600) # 1 hr - equivalent to hms(seconds = 3600)
    hms::hms(0) 
    hms::hms(60) # 1 min
    
    attributes(hms::hms(1))
    ```
    
    
1.  Try and make a tibble that has columns with different lengths. What
    happens?
    
    You get an error unless it is a scalar (vector of length = 1) and
    a column with length > 1. I.e. you can't combine a column of length = 2,
    and another of length = 4 as with base R.
    
    ```{r, error = TRUE}
    x <- c(2)
    y <- letters[1:5]
    tibble(x = x, y = y)
    
    x <- c(1:5)
    y <- letters[1:10]
    tibble(x = x, y = y)
    ```
    

1.  Based on the definition above, is it ok to have a list as a
    column of a tibble?
    
    Yes it is ok, but you will need a list for every observation.
    
    ```{r}
    x <- list(list(1,2), list(3,4))
    y <- letters[1:2]
    tibble(x = x, y = y)
    ```
