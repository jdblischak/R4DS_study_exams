## Create Date and Times

```{r}
today()
now()
```

### From Strings

#### Dates

```{r}
ymd("2017-01-31")
mdy("january 31st, 2017")
dmy("31-Jan-2017")
ymd(20170131)
```

#### Date Times

```{r}
ymd_hms("2017-01-31 20:11:59")
mdy_hm("01/31/2017 08:01")
# force a dttm creation by supplying a tz
ymd(20170131, tz = "UTC")
dmy(31012017, tz = "Africa/Johannesburg")
```

### From Individual Components

Sometimes date and time components are scattered over multiple columns in 
your data. This is the case in the `flights` data.

You can use <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`make_date()`</span> 
and <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`make_datetime()`</span>
to create a date or dttm field.

```{r md, include=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, minute)

flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, minute) %>% 
  mutate(
    departure = make_datetime(year = year, month = month, day = day, 
                              hour = hour, min = minute)
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("md") %>% 
  flair("make_datetime", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

```{r mdttm, include=FALSE}
make_dttm <- function(year, month, day, time){
  # this func will make a proper dttm for the dep_time,
  # sched_dep_time etc.
  make_datetime(year, month, day,
                # divide by 100 and get the integer part - hour part
                time %/% 100,
                # divide by 100 and get the remainder - minutes part
                time %% 100
                )
}

(flights_dt <- flights %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dep_time), !is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
  mutate(
    dep_time = make_dttm(year, month, day, dep_time),
    sched_dep_time = make_dttm(year, month, day, sched_dep_time),
    arr_time = make_dttm(year, month, day, arr_time),
    sched_arr_time = make_dttm(year, month, day, sched_arr_time)
  ) %>% 
  select(origin, dest, ends_with("delay"), ends_with("time")))

flights_dt %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) +
  # how's the distribution across the year looking?
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 24*60*60) # binwidth = 1 day

flights_dt %>% 
  filter(dep_time < ymd(20130102)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_time)) +
  # how's the distribution of dep times across a day looking
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 15 * 60) # how's it looking every 15 min
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("mdttm") %>% 
  flair("make_datetime", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

Note that when you use date-times in a numeric context (like in a histogram), <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">1 means 1 second</span>, so <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">a binwidth of 86400 means one day</span>. __For dates, 1 means 1 day__.

### From other types

You may want to switch between a __date-time__ and a __date__. That's the job of <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`as_datetime()`</span> and <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`as_date()`</span>.

```{r md2, include=FALSE}
as_datetime(today()) # today() returns a date, convert to dttm
as_date(now()) # now() returns a dttm, convert to date
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("md2") %>% 
  flair("as_datetime", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("as_date", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

Sometimes you'll get date/times as numeric offsets from the "Unix Epoch", 1970-01-01. If the offset is in seconds, use `as_datetime()`; if it's in days, use `as_date()`.

```{r defaultdt, include = FALSE}
as_datetime(60 * 60 * 10) # add 10 hours to default dttm 1970-01-01 UTC
as_datetime(0) # default dttm
as_date(365 * 10 + 2) # add 10 years (365 * 10) + 2 days to get to 1980-01-01
as_date(365 * 10) # add 10 years - 365 days per year * 10
as_date(0) # default date (add 0 days)
as_date(10) # add 10 days to default
make_date() # default == Unix Epoch Date
make_datetime() # default == Unix Epoch Date
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("defaultdt") %>% 
  flair("1970-01-01", background = "#cfdad4", 
        color = "#6d6875") %>% 
  flair("1970-01-01 UTC", background = "#cfdad4", 
        color = "#6d6875")
```



### Exercises

1.  What happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
    ```
    ```{r, warning = TRUE}
    ymd(c("2010-10-10", "bananas"))
    ```
    
    You get a warning that some failed to parse.
    
1.  What does the `tzone` argument to `today()` do? Why is it important?

    The `today()` and `now()` uses your computer's time and date. This is
    usually accurate for your timezone. For example I am in South Africa
    so you would see _SAST_ when I call `now()`.
    
    But you may want to do analyses that involve other timezones, or UTC 
    itself. You can use this argument to adjust to the timezone you're
    interested in.
    
    ```{r}
    today()
    (utc_today <- today(tzone = "UTC"))
    utc_today == today()
    utc_today == today(tzone = "GMT")
    now()
    now("UTC")
    ```


1.  Use the appropriate lubridate function to parse each of the following dates:

    ```{r}
    d1 <- "January 1, 2010"
    mdy(d1)
    d2 <- "2015-Mar-07"
    ymd(d2)
    d3 <- "06-Jun-2017"
    dmy(d3)
    d4 <- c("August 19 (2015)", "July 1 (2015)")
    mdy(d4)
    d5 <- "12/30/14" # Dec 30, 2014
    mdy(d5)
    ```

<h2>Date-time components</h2>
## Date-time components

We will focus on the accessor functions that let you get and set individual components.

### Getting components

- `year()`
- `month()`
- `mday()` (day of the month)
- `yday()` (day of the year)
- `wday()` (day of the week)
- `hour()`, `minute()`, and `second()`

```{r comp1, include=FALSE}
(datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56"))
year(datetime)

month(datetime)

mday(datetime)

yday(datetime)

wday(datetime)

wday(datetime, 
     label = TRUE) # abbreviated weekday day instead of number

wday(datetime, 
     label = TRUE, 
     abbr = FALSE) # full weekday name 

hour(datetime)

minute(datetime)

second(datetime)

month(datetime, 
      label = TRUE) # abbreviated month name instead of number

month(datetime, label = TRUE, 
      abbr = FALSE) # full month name instead of number
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("comp1") %>% 
  flair("year", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("month", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("mday", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("yday", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("wday", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("hour", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("minute", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("second", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("label = TRUE", background = "#cfdad4", 
        color = "#6d6875") %>% 
  flair("abbr = FALSE", background = "#cfdad4", 
        color = "#6d6875")
  
```

```{r}
(current_dt <- now())
year(current_dt)
month(current_dt)
mday(current_dt)
yday(current_dt)
wday(current_dt) # sunday
wday(current_dt, 
     label = TRUE) # abbreviated weekday day instead of number
wday(current_dt, 
     label = TRUE, 
     abbr = FALSE) # full weekday name 
hour(current_dt)
minute(current_dt)
second(current_dt)
month(current_dt, 
      label = TRUE) # abbreviated month name instead of number
month(current_dt, label = TRUE, 
      abbr = FALSE) # full month name instead of number
```

```{r}
# wday() shows that more flights depart in the week
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(wday = wday(dep_time, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = wday)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# interesting that flights at certain minutes in
# an hour experience lower delays
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(minute = minute(dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(minute) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(minute, avg_delay)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size = n))
```

```{r}
# the scheduled departure time, does not show such
(sched_dep <- flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(minute = minute(sched_dep_time)) %>% 
  group_by(minute) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n())) 

sched_dep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(minute, avg_delay)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(aes(size = n))

sched_dep %>% 
  ggplot(aes(minute, n)) +
  geom_line()
```

You may also round a date to a nearby unit of time, with `floor_date()`, `round_date()`, and `ceiling_date()`. 

Each function takes a vector of dates to change, and then the name of the unit to round down (floor), round up (ceiling), or round to. 

```{r round, include=FALSE}
(x <- ymd_hms("2020-08-08 12:01:59.93")) # Saturday 8th Aug

round_date(x, ".5s")

round_date(x, "sec")

round_date(x, "second")

round_date(x, "minute")

round_date(x, "5 mins")

round_date(x, "hour")

round_date(x, "2 hours")

round_date(x, "day") # it's past afternoon so closer to tomorrow

round_date(x, "week")

round_date(x, "month")

round_date(x, "bimonth") # 1,3,5,7,9,11 are the bimonths

round_date(x, "quarter")

round_date(x, "quarter") == round_date(x, "3 months")

round_date(x, "halfyear")

round_date(x, "year")

round_date(x, "season")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("round") %>% 
  flair('round_date(x, "hour")', background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

```{r floor, include=FALSE}
(x <- ymd_hms("2020-08-08 12:01:59.93")) # Saturday 8th Aug

floor_date(x, ".5s")

floor_date(x, "sec")

floor_date(x, "second")

floor_date(x, "minute")

floor_date(x, "5 mins")

floor_date(x, "hour")

floor_date(x, "2 hours")

floor_date(x, "day") # floor of date hence still today even though closer to tomorrow

floor_date(x, "week") # floor so last sunday NOT tomorrow

floor_date(x, "month")

floor_date(x, "bimonth") # 1,3,5,7,9,11 are the bimonths

floor_date(x, "quarter")

floor_date(x, "quarter") == floor_date(x, "3 months")

floor_date(x, "halfyear")

floor_date(x, "year")

floor_date(x, "season")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("floor") %>% 
  flair('floor_date(x, "hour")', background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

```{r ceil, include=FALSE}
(x <- ymd_hms("2020-08-08 12:01:59.93")) # Saturday 8th Aug

ceiling_date(x, ".5s")

ceiling_date(x, "sec")

ceiling_date(x, "second")

ceiling_date(x, "minute")

ceiling_date(x, "5 mins")

ceiling_date(x, "hour")

ceiling_date(x, "2 hours")

ceiling_date(x, "day") # ceiling of date hence tomorrow

# ceiling so tomorrow which is start of new week
# Sunday 9th August 2020
ceiling_date(x, "week") 

ceiling_date(x, "month")

ceiling_date(x, "bimonth") # 1,3,5,7,9,11 are the bimonths

ceiling_date(x, "quarter")

ceiling_date(x, "quarter") == ceiling_date(x, "3 months")

ceiling_date(x, "halfyear")

ceiling_date(x, "year")

ceiling_date(x, "season")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("ceil") %>% 
  flair('ceiling_date(x, "hour")', background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

### Setting components

You can also use each accessor function to set the components of a date/time.
Note that the accessor functions now appear on the left hand side of `<-`.

```{r set1, include=FALSE}
(datetime <- ymd_hms("2016-07-08 12:34:56"))

# change year
year(datetime) <- 2020
datetime

# change month
month(datetime) <- 01
datetime

# progress time by 1 hr
hour(datetime) <- hour(datetime) + 1
datetime
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("set1") %>% 
  flair("year(datetime) <-", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("month(datetime) <-", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

Alternatively, rather than modifying in place, you can create a new date-time with `update()`. This also allows you to set multiple values at once.

```{r set2, include=FALSE}
update(datetime,
       year = 2020,
       month = 02,
       mday = 02,
       hour = 15)

datetime

# entered a too big date / hour / min? 
# these roll over
ymd("2020-02-27") %>% 
  update(mday = 29)

ymd("2020-02-27") %>% 
  update(mday = 30, hour = 22,
         min = 65)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("set2") %>% 
  flair("update", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") 
```

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  # ignore the date, let's make a new date that pulls all observations
  # back to the 1st of Jan
  mutate(dep_hour = update(dep_time, yday = 1)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sched_dep_time)) %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

# let's visualise how many flights leave at different hours in 
# the day by pretending all flights occurred on the same day
# the 1st Jan
flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(dep_hour = update(dep_time, yday = 1)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(dep_hour)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 60 * 5) # every 5 min
```


### Exercises

1.  How does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the 
    course of the year?
    
    ```{r}
    # devtools::install_github("sciencificity/werpals")
    library(werpals)
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(month = factor(month(dep_time)),
             dep_hour = update(dep_time, yday = 1)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(dep_hour, colour = month)) +
      geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 60 * 30) +
      scale_colour_nature(palette = "bryce")
    ```
    
    Feb is lower but it has less days as well.
    
1.  Compare `dep_time`, `sched_dep_time` and `dep_delay`. Are they consistent?
    Explain your findings.
    
    The $sched\_dep\_time + dep\_delay = dep\_time$.
    It does for most observations but there is a handful that does not meet this
    relationship.
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      select(year, month, day, hour, minute, dep_time, sched_dep_time,
             dep_delay)
    flights_dt %>% 
      select(dep_time, sched_dep_time,
             dep_delay) %>% 
      mutate(act_dep_time = sched_dep_time + 
               hms(str_glue("0, {dep_delay}, 0"))) %>% 
      filter(dep_time != act_dep_time)
    ```
    

1.  Compare `air_time` with the duration between the departure and arrival.
    Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      select(origin, dest, dep_time, arr_time, air_time) %>% 
      filter(!is.na(air_time), !is.na(dep_time), 
             !is.na(arr_time)) %>% 
      mutate(dest_same_tz = dep_time + 
               hms(str_glue("0, {air_time}, 0"))) %>% 
      filter(arr_time == dest_same_tz)
    
    ```
    
    There are only a few where the $dep\_time + air\_time = arr\_time$. If you look
    at the dest vs the origin I would have suspected that the airports
    in the same timezone align but LGA and ORD are different timezones and they
    align, LGA and BNA also and others too. So truly I am unsure without
    further digging.
    
1.  How does the average delay time change over the course of a day?
    Should you use `dep_time` or `sched_dep_time`? Why?
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(sched_dep_hr = update(sched_dep_time, yday = 1),
             hr_day = hour(sched_dep_hr)) %>% 
      group_by(hr_day) %>% 
      summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                n = n()) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(hr_day, avg_delay)) +
      geom_point(aes(size = n)) +
      geom_line()
    ```
    
    I used `sched_dep_time` since that is when the flight should
    have left and is a more accurate reflection of how delay time
    changes over the course of a day.
    

1.  On what day of the week should you leave if you want to minimise the
    chance of a delay?
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(day_of_week = wday(sched_dep_time, abbr = TRUE, label = TRUE)) %>% 
      group_by(day_of_week) %>% 
      summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
                n = n()) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(day_of_week, avg_delay)) +
      geom_col()
    ```
    
    You best leave on Saturday.
    

1.  What makes the distribution of `diamonds$carat` and 
    `flights$sched_dep_time` similar?
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>% 
      count(carat, sort = TRUE)
    
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(sched_min = minute(sched_dep_time)) %>% 
      count(sched_min, sort = TRUE)
    
    # out of curiosity how does actual dep_time look?
    flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(min = minute(dep_time)) %>% 
      count(min, sort = TRUE)
    ```
    
    More flights are scheduled at round numbers that we talk about often;
    quarter past, half past, 6 'o clock, etc. The actual departure
    time is much less aligned with how we talk. We don't usually talk about
    out flight being 54 minutes past 5! Except when we were kids learning
    to tell time, then we're very precise (ask my 6yo who keeps reminding me
    when I say it's nearly half past 8 and time for bed, that actually
    it is only 8:26 so he has 4 more minutes `r emo::ji("haha")`).
    
    For carats it is similar 0.3, 0.7, 0.4 but there are some 
    anomalies for example 0.32 or 0.31 or even 1.01.
    

1.  Confirm my hypothesis that the early departures of flights in minutes
    20-30 and 50-60 are caused by scheduled flights that leave early. 
    Hint: create a binary variable that tells you whether or not a flight 
    was delayed.
    
    ```{r}
    flights_dt %>% 
      filter(!is.na(dep_delay)) %>% 
      mutate(early = dep_delay < 0,
             dep_min = minute(update(dep_time, yday = 1))) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(dep_min, fill = early)) +
      geom_bar() +
      scale_fill_disney(palette = "pan")
    ```
    
    The flights that leave in minutes `22 - 29` and `49 - 59` do leave earlier 
    than scheduled. 

<h2>Time spans</h2>
## Time spans

Now we're gonna see how arithmetic with dates works and learn about three 
important classes that represent time spans:

* __durations__, which represent an exact number of seconds.
* __periods__, which represent human units like weeks and months.
* __intervals__, which represent a starting and ending point.

### Durations

When we subtract two dates, we get a `difftime` object.

```{r}
# How old is Hadley?
(h_age <- today() - ymd(19791014))
```

A `difftime` class object records a time span of 

- seconds, 
- minutes, 
- hours, 
- days, or 
- weeks. 

The ambiguity can make `difftimes` painful to work with, so {lubridate} provides 
an alternative which always uses seconds: the __duration__.

```{r}
as.duration(h_age)
```

#### Duration constructors

```{r durations, include=FALSE}
dseconds(15)

dminutes(10)

dhours(c(12,24))

ddays(0:5)

dweeks(3)

dweeks(3) == 24 * 60 * 60 * 7 * 3 # 24 hrs, 60 min, 60 s in each min, 7 days, 3 weeks

dyears(1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("durations") %>% 
  flair("ds", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("dm", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("dh", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("dd", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("dw", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("dy", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

Durations always record the time span in seconds. Larger units are converted
using standard rules e.g. 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 
24 hours in day, 7 days in a week, and 365 days in a year. Notice all
duration constructors start with __d__ and end with __s__ (i.e. the plural
of each time span - **d**day**s**)

#### Duration Arithmetic

You can add and multiply durations.

```{r}
2 * dyears(1)
dyears(2)

dyears(1)  + dweeks(12) + dhours(15)
```

We can also add and subtract durations to and from dates.

```{r}
(tomorrow <- today() + ddays(1))
(last_yr <- year(today() - dyears(1)))
```

But durations represent an exact number of seconds, and hence sometimes 
you might get unexpected results, especially with daylight savings etc.
that complicate date time arithmetic.

```{r}
(one_pm <- ymd_hms("2016-03-12 13:00:00",
                  tz = "America/New_York"))
one_pm + ddays(1)
```

One day after 1pm on March 12, is 2pm on March 13?! `r emo::ji("confused")` 
The tz has changed from EST to EDT due to daylight savings time.

### Periods

To solve this problem, {lubridate} provides __periods__. Periods are time spans 
that work with "human" times, like days and months. 

```{r}
one_pm
one_pm + days(1)
```

#### Period constructors

```{r}
seconds(15)

minutes(10)

hours(c(12, 24))

days(0:5)

weeks(3)

years(1)

months(1:6)
```

#### Period Arithmetic

```{r}
2 * years(1)
years(2)

years(1) + weeks(12) + hours(15)

10 * (months(6) + days(1))

days(50) + hours(25) + minutes(2)
```

Compared to durations, periods are more likely to do what you expect.

```{r}
# A leap year
ymd(20200101) + dyears(1)
ymd(20200101) + years(1)

one_pm
one_pm + ddays(1)
one_pm + days(1)
```

Some planes appear to have arrived at their destination _before_ they departed 
from NYC.

```{r}
flights_dt %>% 
  filter(arr_time < dep_time)
```

They are overnight flights and incorrectly have the same date information for 
both the departure and the arrival times.

```{r}
(flights_dt <- flights_dt %>% 
  mutate(overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
         arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight * 1),
         sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight + 1))) %>% 
  filter(overnight == TRUE) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

flights_dt %>% 
  filter(overnight, arr_time < dep_time)
```


### Intervals

`dyears(1) / ddays(365)` returns one, because durations are always represented 
by a number of seconds, and a duration of a year is defined as 365 days 
worth of seconds.

For `years(1) / days(1)` it gives an estimate, and a warning.

```{r}
dyears(1) / ddays(365)

years(1) / days(1)
```

For more accurate measurements, use an __interval__. An interval is a 
duration with a starting point and hence you can determine how long it is.

```{r}
(next_yr <- today() + years(1))
 
(today() %--% next_yr)

# to find how many periods in an _interval_ use integer division
(today() %--% next_yr) %/% days(1)

# for duration you can use / or integer division 
# for consistency probably %/% is better
(today() %--% next_yr) %/% ddays(1)
```

### Exercises

1.  Why is there `months()` but no `dmonths()`?
    
    A month is not easily converted to a number of seconds, because
    a month could be 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 28 days, 30 days, or 31 days.
    
    For a day we use standard convention of 24 hours in a day, and convert that
    to seconds, same for a week (7 days of 24 each day). But with months
    there is no standard number.


1.  Explain `days(overnight * 1)` to someone who has just started 
    learning R. How does it work?
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    (flights_dt <- flights_dt %>% 
      mutate(overnight = arr_time < dep_time,
             arr_time = arr_time + days(overnight * 1),
             sched_arr_time = sched_arr_time + days(overnight + 1))) %>% 
      filter(overnight == TRUE) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    ```
    
    
    `overnight` is a logical value - in the df each arr_time is checked against
    dep_time if it is before the departure time? 
    
    - it is: marked as TRUE (anomalies we are looking for).
    - it is not: marked as FALSE.
    
    We need to progress our anomaly arr_times on by `1 day`.
    
    - For our anomalies overnight == TRUE which behind the scenes is the integer
    1 (for yes, this criterion is met). $overnight * 1 = 1 * 1 = 1$. The 
    arrival time is progressed one day forward and is now accurate.
    - For normal flights (the arrival time is after the departure time) 
    overnight == FALSE which behind the scenes is the integer 0 (for nope, 
    this criterion is __not__ met). $overnight * 1 = 0 * 1 = 0$. The 
    arrival time is unchanged since it is already correct.

1.  Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015.
    Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month
    in the _current_ year.

    ```{r}
    ymd(20150101) + months(0:11)
    floor_date(today(), "year") + months(0:11)
    ```

1.  Write a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns 
    how old you are in years.
    
    ```{r}
    age <- function(dob){
      secs <- as.duration(today() - dob)
      secs / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365)
    }
    
    age(ymd(20140612))
    ```
    

1.  Why can't `(today() %--% (today() + years(1))) / months(1)` work?
    
    It works but I suspect that the `/` should be replaced by `%/%` integer
    division.

    ```{r}
    # how many months in the timespan today - next_yr_this_time
    (today() %--% (today() + years(1))) %/% months(1)
    ```

<h2>Timezones</h2>
## Timezones

```{r}
# what is my timezone?
Sys.timezone()
```

Get a list of tz's.

```{r}
length(OlsonNames())
head(OlsonNames())
tail(OlsonNames())
```

In Base R: the time zone is an attribute of the date-time that only controls 
printing.

```{r}
(x1 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 12:00:00", tz = "America/New_York"))
(x2 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-01 18:00:00", tz = "Europe/Copenhagen"))
(x3 <- ymd_hms("2015-06-02 04:00:00", tz = "Pacific/Auckland"))

# verify same time
x1 - x2
x1 - x3
```

{lubridate} always uses UTC.

```{r}
# tz dropped
x4 <- c(x1, x2, x3)
x4

# change tz for display
x4a <- with_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
x4a
x4a - x4

# change tz to fix an incorrect tz
x4b <- force_tz(x4, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
x4b
x4b - x4
```
