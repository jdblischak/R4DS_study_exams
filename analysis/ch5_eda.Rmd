## Patterns

- Variation: Best way to understand the pattern in a variable is to visualise
the distribution of the variables values.

  * Categorical: Bar chart
  * Continuous: Histogram
  * In both: 
      
      + tall bars == common values of the variable
      + short bars == less common values of the variable
      + no bars == absense of that value in your data

### Investigate Categories

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut))

diamonds %>% 
  count(cut)
```

```{r cat1, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = species))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("cat1") %>% 
  flair("geom_bar", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

```{r cat2, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = sex))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("cat2") %>% 
  flair("geom_bar", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

```{r cat3, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = island))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("cat3") %>% 
  flair("geom_bar", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```
  
### Investigate Continuous Data

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.5)

# computing yourself? use the count + cut_width!
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut_width(carat, 0.5))
```

```{r con1, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = bill_length_mm), 
                 binwidth = 0.6)

penguins %>% 
  count(cut_width(bill_length_mm, 0.6))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("con1") %>% 
  flair("geom_histogram", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("count", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("cut_width", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")  
```

The data looks bimodal - i.e. there are 2 bumps in the distribution. 
If we recall we have 3 species, so let's fill in the bars based on the
species.

```{r con2, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = bill_length_mm, fill = species),
                 alpha = 0.5,
                 binwidth = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_tq()

penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  count(cut_width(bill_length_mm, 0.6))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("con2") %>% 
  flair("geom_histogram", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("fill = species", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") 
```

When we have overlapping histograms, the suggestion is to use <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`geom_freqpoly()`</span> which 
uses lines instead of bars.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 3)

ggplot(data = smaller) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = carat), binwidth = 0.1)

ggplot(data = smaller) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = carat, colour = cut), binwidth = 0.1)

ggplot(data = smaller, aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01)
```

```{r con3, include=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x = bill_length_mm, colour = species),
                binwidth = 0.6) +
  scale_fill_tq()
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("con3") %>% 
  flair("geom_freqpoly", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") 
```

Looking at the plots ask some questions of your data:

* Which values are the most common? Why?

* Which values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?

* Can you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?


Clusters of similar values suggest that subgroups exist in your data. To understand the subgroups, ask:

* How are the observations within each cluster similar to each other?

* How are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?

* How can you explain or describe the clusters?

* Why might the appearance of clusters be misleading?

### Investigate Unusual Values

Outliers are observations that don't seem to gel nicely with the rest of the
data. 

Here the long y-axis indicates some outliers.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  # y is a var in the dataset! it measures one of the
  # dimensions of the diamond
  geom_histogram(aes(x = y), 
                 binwidth = 0.5)
```

To zoom in lets use <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`coord_cartesian()`</span> with the
`ylim` variable.

The <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`coord_cartesian()`</span> also has an `xlim`
to zoom into the x-axis.

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  # limit the y-axis to btw 0-50! Note to self: DON'T CONFUSE with the x-axis
  # which is named `y`!!
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,50)) +
  labs(x = "The variable y in the diamonds dataset")

# zoom into the unusual values
(unusual <- diamonds %>% 
    filter(y < 3 | y > 20) %>% 
    arrange(y)) %>% 
  print(width = Inf) # print the whole dataset so we can see all cols
```

The y feature in the diamonds dataset measures a dimension (width, height,
depth) in millimeters. A dimension of 0 mm is incorrect, and a dimension
of ~32mm or ~59mm is also incorrect. Those diamonds will cost an
`r emo::ji("biceps")` and a `r emo::ji("leg")`!

In __practice__ it is best to do analysis _with and without_ your outliers.

* No difference with or without, probably safe to remove them
* Big difference with vs without, need to investigate why they are there
before any action.
* In both cases, disclose the action taken in your analysis.

### Exercises

1.  Explore the distribution of each of the `x`, `y`, and `z` variables 
    in `diamonds`. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you
    might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x=x),
                     binwidth = 0.5)
    
    filter(diamonds, x == max(x)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    filter(diamonds, x == min(x)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    diamonds %>% 
      filter(x != 0) %>% 
      filter(x == min(x)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = x), binwidth = 0.5) +
      coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1),
                      ylim = c(0, 10))
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = y),
                     binwidth = 0.5)
    
    filter(diamonds, y == max(y)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    filter(diamonds, y == min(y)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    diamonds %>% 
      filter(y != 0) %>% 
      filter(y == min(y)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)    
    
    diamonds %>% 
      filter(y < 10) %>% 
      filter(y == max(y)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)    
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = z),
                     binwidth = 0.5)
    
    filter(diamonds, z == max(z)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    filter(diamonds, z == min(z)) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    unusual_z <- diamonds %>% 
      filter(z < 2 | z > 10)
    
    ggplot(data = unusual_z) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = z), binwidth = 0.5) +
      coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 35),
                      ylim = c(0, 25))
    
    diamonds %>% 
      select(x, y, z) %>% 
      filter(x != 0,
             y != 0, 
             z != 0) %>% 
      skim()    
    ```
    
    So it turns out a diamond has a table, width and depth. 
    
    <div class="pic right">
    <img src="assets/diamond.PNG" alt="Dimensions of a diamond; Credit: https://www.diamonds.pro/" /> 
    <p><cite>Credit: https://www.diamonds.pro/</cite></p>
    </div>
    
    x and y could be depth or width - there's not much difference
    between the 2 values. The z is likely to be the `table` since it is
    smaller.
    
    But looking at the `?diamonds` help page x = length, y = width and
    z = depth, and there is actually a table variable that is a relative 
    measure `r emo::ji("doubt")`, so there goes my "theory" 
    `r emo::ji("exasperation")`.

1.  Explore the distribution of `price`. Do you discover anything unusual
    or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the `binwidth` and make sure
    you try a wide range of values.)
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = price), bins = 20)
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = price), binwidth = 1000)
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = price), binwidth = 200)
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(aes(x = price), binwidth = 500)
    
    diamonds %>% 
      select(price) %>% 
      skim()
    
    diamonds %>% 
      filter(price == 326 |
               price == 18823) %>% 
      gt()
    
    diamonds %>% 
      arrange(-carat) %>% 
      head(10) %>% 
      gt()
      
    ```
    
    <br>
    
    The prices range from $326 to $18823. The carat of the high priced
    $18823 diamond is 2.29. There are other diamonds where the carat is
    bigger, and the cut is also Premium yet the price is lower. So it seems 
    diamond pricing considers many factors, and could also be determined on
    who is doing the selling.
    

1.  How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What
    do you think is the cause of the difference?
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>%   
      filter(
             carat == 1 |
             carat == 0.99
            ) %>%  
      count(carat, sort = TRUE)
    
    sample_test <- diamonds %>% 
      filter(carat == 1 |
             carat == 0.99) %>% 
      group_by(carat) %>% 
      arrange(carat, price)
      
    sample_test %>%   
      sample_n(20) %>% 
      gt()
    
    sample_test %>% 
      select(cut, price) %>% 
      skim()
    
    ```
    
    <br>
    
    The one carat diamonds are gigher in price and hugely so in the upper
    range.
    
1.  Compare and contrast `coord_cartesian()` vs `xlim()` or `ylim()` when
    zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave `binwidth` unset?
    What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
      # limit the y-axis to btw 0-50! 
      # Note to self: DON'T CONFUSE with the x-axis
      # which is named `y`!!
      coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,50)) +
      labs(x = "The variable y in the diamonds dataset")
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
      ylim(c(0,50)) +
      labs(x = "The variable y in the diamonds dataset")
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y)) +
      ylim(c(0,50)) +
      labs(x = "The variable y in the diamonds dataset")    
    
    ```
    
    Documentation reads: "This is a shortcut for supplying 
    the limits argument to the individual scales. Note that,
    by default, any values outside the limits will be 
    replaced with NA." So `ylim()` and `xlim()` replace 
    values outside the limit with NULL values resulting
    in the histogram being quite different to what we have
    when we use `coord_cartesian()`.
    
    If we don't supply a binwidth ggplot defaults the 
    number of bins to display to 30, and hence 
    implicitly picks a binwidth for us.
    

## Leveraging Missing Values

When you have weird values for variables, e.g. the ~59 mm for y, you may be tempted to drop these values and carry on. 
Often though a dataset is not nice and neat with all it's weird values in a few observations! Usually the weird
values are spread over multiple observations!

```{r}

diamonds %>% 
  mutate(row_num = row_number()) %>% 
  filter(x==0 | y==0 | z==0) %>% 
  gt()
  
```

<br>

Throwing away all observations where a variable has weird values can result in a serious shrinking of your dataset.

The authors suggest that instead of throwing away the observations with weird values, rather replace them with `missing values`. This may sound strange since many of us
have probably heard that `missing values` shouldn't be used in data science! It's usually a _problem_ to be fixed!

But in EDA it may provide insight to either force weird values to be NA, or to investigate how missing values differ from non-missing values.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = if_else((y < 3 | y > 20), NA_real_, y))

diamonds2 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
  
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE, warning=TRUE}
nycflights13::flights %>% 
  mutate(cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
         sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
         sched_min = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
         sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sched_dep_time)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cancelled), binwidth = 1/4)

```

### Exercises

1.  What happens to missing values in a histogram?  What happens to missing
    values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference?
    
    Missing values in bar charts are plotted as a category.
    Missing values in a histogram are dropped.
    
    I guess that it is easy to create one category for 
    missing and lump all the missing variable observations
    into that count.
    
    For a continuous variable where data is binned 
    however how do you show that on a graph? The limits are
    continuous values e.g. from 0 - 100, -100 - 100 etc. 
    Where should the count of NAs go on the x-axis, and
    y-axis given that the range that NA could represent
    is any number in the range of the continuous values 
    we have for a variable.


1.  What does `na.rm = TRUE` do in `mean()` and `sum()`?
    
    The NAs are removed and then the mean() or sum() is
    computed on the remaining non-NA values.
    
    ```{r}
    c(1,2,NA,3,4,NA,5) %>% 
      mean(na.rm=TRUE)
    # (1+2+3+4+5) / 5 = 15 / 5 = 3
    
    c(1,2,NA,3,4,NA,5) %>% 
      sum(na.rm=TRUE)
    # (1+2+3+4+5)
    ```

## Covariation

Covariance is how two or more variables change together in some way. Visualisation is good for noticing these relationships.

### Categorical and Continuous

#### Density Freq Polygons

We previously used a `geom_freqpoly()` for this, which doesn't
provide much use if groups are unbalanced. If one group is much smaller than the others it's hard to see differences.

We can display `density` on the y-axis instead of a count. 
<span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`..density..`</span> is a count that is standardised so that the area under each curve is __1__.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)

# it's hard to see difference because counts are so diff
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = cut))

# to make the comparison easier we swap what is displayed
# on the y-axis
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = cut), binwidth = 500)

# the surprising thing is that Fair diamonds (lowest qual)
# seem to have the highest average price?
diamonds %>% 
  group_by(cut) %>% 
  summarise(avg_price = mean(price)) %>% 
  arrange(-avg_price)
# not really - it is actual Premium, but Fair is not
# too far behind.
```

```{r dense, include=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 200)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 200)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_depth_mm, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = ..density..)) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 5)
```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("dense") %>% 
  flair("..density..", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

#### Boxplots

Verbatim from the book:

* A box that stretches from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 
  75th percentile, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR). In the
  middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile,
  of the distribution. These three lines give you a sense of the spread of the
  distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the
  median or skewed to one side. 

* Visual points that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the 
  IQR from either edge of the box. These outlying points are unusual
  so are plotted individually.

* A line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the   
  farthest non-outlier point in the distribution.

### Exercises

1.  Use what you've learned to improve the visualisation of the departure times
    of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights.
    
    ```{r}
    nycflights13::flights %>% 
      mutate(cancelled = is.na(dep_time),
             sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
             sched_min = sched_dep_time %/% 100,
             sched_dep_time = sched_hour + sched_min / 60) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time, y = cancelled)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ```
    

1.  What variable in the diamonds dataset is most important for predicting
    the price of a diamond? How is that variable correlated with cut?
    Why does the combination of those two relationships lead to lower quality
    diamonds being more expensive?
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
      geom_point()
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(cut, price,
                                     median), y = price)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(color, price,
                                     median), y = price)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(clarity,
                                     price, median),
                         y = price)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(cut, carat,
                                     median), 
                         y = carat)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(color, carat,
                                     median), y = carat)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(clarity, carat,
                                     median), y = carat)) +
      geom_boxplot()
    
    
    cor(diamonds$price, diamonds$carat)
    ```
    
    They say that there are 4 characteristics of diamonds that
    come into play when considering the quality - Carat
    Weight, Cut, Colour and Clarity. It looks like carat, is
    most correlated with the price, and there are quite a few
    low quality for the Cut of the diamonds that have a big
    carat weight.

1.  Install the ggstance package, and create a horizontal boxplot.
    How does this compare to using `coord_flip()`?
    
    There is no longer a need to use the ggstance 
    `r emo::ji("package")` as this functionality is
    provided in [ggplot2 since version 3.3.0](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggstance/readme/README.html).
    

1.  One problem with boxplots is that they were developed in an era of 
    much smaller datasets and tend to display a prohibitively large
    number of "outlying values". One approach to remedy this problem is
    the letter value plot. Install the lvplot package, and try using
    `geom_lv()` to display the distribution of price vs cut. What
    do you learn? How do you interpret the plots?
    
    ```{r}
    library(lvplot)
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(reorder(cut,
                                 price, median), price)) +
      geom_boxplot() +
      labs(x = "Cut",
           y = "Price")
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(reorder(cut, price,
                                 median), price)) +
      geom_lv(outlier.colour = "darkgreen") +
      labs(x = "Cut", y = "Price")
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(reorder(cut, price,
                                 median), price)) +
      geom_lv(aes(fill = ..LV..), outlier.colour = "darkgreen",
              k = 6) +
      labs(x = "Cut", y = "Price") +
      scale_fill_lv()
    ```
    
    The plots are an [extension of the boxplots](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/lvplot/versions/0.2.0/topics/geom_lv) 
    and allows you to see the distribution better especially
    for large datasets. More information on the plot can be
    found [here](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/letter-value-plot.pdf).

1.  Compare and contrast `geom_violin()` with a facetted `geom_histogram()`,
    or a coloured `geom_freqpoly()`. What are the pros and cons of each 
    method?
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, body_mass_g)) +
      geom_violin(aes(colour = species))
    
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
      geom_histogram() +
      facet_wrap(~ species,
                 ncol = 1,
                 scales = "free_y")
    
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, y = ..density..)) +
      geom_freqpoly(aes(colour = species), binwidth = 200)
    
    ```
    
    They're all pretty similar, but I think the geom_freqpoly()
    and geom_violin() use density and hence is harder to 
    interpret.
    

1.  If you have a small dataset, it's sometimes useful to use `geom_jitter()`
    to see the relationship between a continuous and categorical variable.
    The ggbeeswarm package provides a number of methods similar to 
    `geom_jitter()`. List them and briefly describe what each one does.
        
    ```{r}
    library(ggbeeswarm)
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, body_mass_g)) +
        geom_quasirandom()
    
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, body_mass_g)) +
        geom_beeswarm()
    
    ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, bill_depth_mm)) +
        geom_beeswarm()
    
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = reorder(cut, price,
                                    median), y = price)) +
          geom_quasirandom()
  
    ```
    
    The <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`ggbeeswarm`</span> `r emo::ji("package")` produces _column scatter plots_ and
    has [2 functions](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm), 
    one `geom_quasirandom()` reduces the overplotting and also
    helps visualise the density at each point.
    
    The other is `geom_beeswarm()` and does a point-size offset.
    

### Two Categorical Variables

For two catgories we need to count the number of observations
in each combination of the 2 categories.

We can use <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`geom_count()`</span> for this, and the size of
each dot tells you how many observations fell in
that category.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_count(aes(x = cut, y = color))

diamonds %>% 
  count(cut, color, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r geom_count, include=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_count(aes(x = species, y = island))

penguins %>% 
  count(species, island, sort = TRUE)

ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_count(aes(x = species, y = sex))


penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("geom_count") %>% 
  flair("geom_count", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

We can see that the largest number of observations
were of the Gentoo species, on the island Biscoe.

The male / female splits look roughly equal and is
confirmed using a count().

Another way is to use the <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`geom_tile()`</span> function but here you must first compute the count,
and then use the count as a __fill__.


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
diamonds %>% 
  count(cut, color) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n))

```


```{r geom_tile, include=FALSE}
penguins %>% 
  count(species, island) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = island)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n ))

penguins %>% 
  count(species, island, sort = TRUE)

penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = species, y = sex)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = n ))

penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("geom_tile") %>% 
  flair("geom_tile", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

We see that the colouring for the tiled graph of
species and sex show again that the data is
quite balanced in terms of males vs females for each
species. The NA values also only appear for _Adelie_ and
_Gentoo_.

### Exercises

1.  How could you rescale the count dataset above to more clearly show
    the distribution of cut within colour, or colour within cut?

    Original:
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>% 
      count(color, cut) %>%  
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n))
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>% 
      add_count(color, cut) %>%  
      group_by(color) %>% 
      mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = perc)) +
      scale_fill_gradient(low = "#999999",
                          high = "gold") +
      guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                    barheight = 0.5))
    ```
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>% 
      add_count(cut, color) %>%  
      group_by(cut) %>% 
      mutate(perc = n / sum(n) * 100) %>% 
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = perc)) +
      scale_fill_gradient(low = "#F4EDCA",
                          high = "#293352") +
      guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                    barheight = 0.5))
    ```
    Maybe use a percentage within each color.
    

1.  Use `geom_tile()` together with dplyr to explore how average flight
    delays vary by destination and month of year.  What makes the 
    plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      group_by(dest, month) %>% 
      mutate(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = month, y = dest)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = avg_delay)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "#F4EDCA",
                            high = "#293352") +
        guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                      barheight = 0.5))  
    
    flights %>% 
      mutate(dest = fct_lump(dest, 10)) %>% 
      group_by(dest, month) %>% 
      mutate(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = month, y = dest)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = avg_delay)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "#F4EDCA",
                            high = "#293352") +
        guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                      barheight = 0.5))
    
    ```
    The missing values for some months is an issue. There are
    many destinations. It will be better to sort it by the
    highest number of flights and highest average delay, and
    then maybe also lump the lower ones into a single category
    with something like `fct_lump()` which we will learn 
    about later. For now just see `fct_lump(var, n = 8)` as 
    lumping together factors that are less frequent. Here we
    keep the most frequent or top 8 of the variable  `var`.
    In the example above we kept the 10 most frequent 
    destinations, and lumped the rest into `Other`.

1.  Why is it slightly better to use `aes(x = color, y = cut)` rather
    than `aes(x = cut, y = color)` in the example above?
    
    ```{r}
    diamonds %>% 
      count(color, cut) %>%  
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = color, y = cut)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "#F4EDCA",
                                high = "#293352") +
        guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                          barheight = 0.5))
    
    diamonds %>% 
      count(cut, color) %>%  
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = color)) +
        geom_tile(mapping = aes(fill = n)) +
        scale_fill_gradient(low = "#F4EDCA",
                                high = "#293352") +
        guides(fill = guide_colourbar(barwidth = 10, 
                                          barheight = 0.5))
        
    ```

    For me it is easier to read.  I can say in the color `D`
    there is approximately 200 observations of the cut `Fair`,
    ~ 500 observations of the cut `Good` etc. I.e. there
    is more variation in the cut within each color than the
    other way around if that makes sense.
    
    If I read the color in each cut, there's not much
    variation, e.g. for the `Fair` cut ~200 lie in every
    color.
    
### Two Continuous Variables

One way we have already seen is the <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`geom_point()`</span>.
When you have lots of data you can use an `alpha` value to
prevent the overplotting, and see you data more clearly.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price),
             alpha = 1/100)
```

```{r geom_point1, include=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                 y = bill_depth_mm))

ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                 y = bill_depth_mm,
                 colour = species))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("geom_point1") %>% 
  flair("geom_point", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

It seems there is an upward trend but it is hard to make
it out.

```{r geom_point2, include=FALSE}

ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_point(aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                 y = bill_depth_mm,
                 colour = species))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("geom_point2") %>% 
  flair("colour = species", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

Ah that's much better, when the data is segmented by species
we can see a trend.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price),
             alpha = 1/100)
```

With large datasets you can also bin your data and use
`geom_bin2d()` and `geom_hex()`.

Or alternately you can bin one variable to act as though
it is categorical e.g. using `cut_width()`, then we can
use one of the visualisations suitable for a categorical
and continuous combination.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
smaller <- diamonds %>%
  filter(carat < 3)

ggplot(smaller) +
  geom_bin2d(aes(x = carat, y = price))

ggplot(smaller) +
  geom_hex(aes(carat, price))

ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, 
                                     y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 
                                               0.1)))

ggplot(data = smaller, 
       mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_number(carat, 20)))  
```

#### Exercises

1.  Instead of summarising the conditional distribution with a boxplot, you
    could use a frequency polygon. What do you need to consider when using
    `cut_width()` vs `cut_number()`? How does that impact a visualisation of
    the 2d distribution of `carat` and `price`?
    
    ```{r}
    smaller <- diamonds %>%
      filter(carat < 3)
    
    ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(colour = 
                                           cut_width(carat, 
                                                   0.4), 
                                         x = price)) + 
      geom_freqpoly()
    
    ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(colour = 
                                           cut_number(carat, 
                                                   6), 
                                         x = price)) + 
      geom_freqpoly()
    
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(colour = 
                                           cut_width(carat, 
                                                   0.8), 
                                         x = price)) + 
      geom_freqpoly()
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(colour = 
                                           cut_number(carat, 
                                                   6), 
                                         x = price)) + 
      geom_freqpoly()
    ```
    `cut_width()` we say what we'd like the binwidth 
    of the variable to be, and the number of bins will 
    be calculated. `cut_number()` we say what we'd like as a
    bin number, and the binwidth of each bin is calculated.

1.  Visualise the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.

    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds,
           aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_number(price, 10)))
    
    ```

1.  How does the price distribution of very large diamonds compare to small 
    diamonds? Is it as you expect, or does it surprise you?
    
    Heavier diamonds cost more than lighter diamonds. This does not surprise
    me, but as you see diamonds in the range 3-5 all get a big price tag,
    so there is more to the pricing mechanism than just carat weight and 
    I would guess this is where the 4C's come in. Heavier diamonds
    attract a big price tag.
    
1.  Combine two of the techniques you've learned to visualise the 
    combined distribution of cut, carat, and price.
    
    ```{r}
    ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
      geom_boxplot(aes(group = cut_number(price, 10))) +
      facet_wrap(~ cut, scales = "free_y")
    ```
    

1. Two dimensional plots reveal outliers that are not visible in one 
   dimensional plots. For example, some points in the plot below have an 
   unusual combination of `x` and `y` values, which makes the points outliers 
   even though their `x` and `y` values appear normal when examined separately.
  
    ```{r, dev = "png"}
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) 
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
      coord_cartesian(xlim = c(4, 11), ylim = c(4, 11))
    
    ggplot(data = diamonds) +
      geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, group=cut_number(y, 10))) +
      coord_cartesian(xlim = c(4, 11), ylim = c(4, 11))
    ```
    
    Why is a scatterplot a better display than a binned plot for this case?
    
    In a binned plot the points are gathered together in a bin and
    you may not notice that it is an outlier.
    
    
### Patterns

If you spot a pattern, some Qs:

+ Could this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?

+ How can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ How strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?

+ What other variables might affect the relationship?

+ Does the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?

```{r}
# old faithful eruption lengths vs wait time
ggplot(faithful) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting))
```
