## Pipes %>%

The ease of reading and writing code in R is a thing of beauty, and is
made so due to the pipe! `r emo::ji("excited")` `r emo::ji("sparkle")` 
`r emo::ji("cool")`. 


> Little bunny Foo Foo  
> Went hopping through the forest  
> Scooping up the field mice  
> And bopping them on the head  

### Intermediate Steps

```{r, eval=FALSE}
foo_foo <-  little_bunny()
foo_foo1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo2 <- scoop(foo_foo1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo3 <- bop(foo_foo2, on = head)
```

- Main downside is that we need to name each intermediate step
and with long data wrangling pipelines this can get tedious.
- The thought is that these extra copies also take up space, but
they don't. R cleverly handles that for us behind the scenes.

```{r}
diamonds <- ggplot2::diamonds
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(price_per_carat = price / carat)

pryr::object_size(diamonds)  # gives memory occupied by all its args
pryr::object_size(diamonds2)
pryr::object_size(diamonds, diamonds2) # collective size of both
```

`diamonds` and `diamonds2` have 10 columns in common. These are shared
by both objects.

If we modify any columns then the number of columns in common reduces. This
is what happens below, and hence the shared size increases.

```{r}
diamonds$carat[1] <- NA
pryr::object_size(diamonds)  # gives memory occupied by all its args
pryr::object_size(diamonds2)
pryr::object_size(diamonds, diamonds2) # collective size of both
```


### Overwrite Original

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo <-  little_bunny()
foo_foo <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo <- scoop(foo_foo, up = field_mice)
foo_foo <- bop(foo_foo, on = head)
```

- Debugging is hard. Need to re-run pipeline to figure out where the error
lies.
- The common variable being overwritten hides whats happening at each step.
E.g. Foo foo is a bunny who is hopping through the forest, and on her
way she scoops up some field mice. A person reading your code will get
confused as to what happened with Foo foo if they read long pipelines,
or worse will think Foo foo can bop something on its head sometimes, 
can hop through a forest sometimes etc. I.e. it's hard to keep track
of what Foo foo is doing.

### Function Composition

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bop(
  scoop(
    hop(
      foo_foo, 
      through = forest
    ), 
    up = field_mice
  ),
  on = head
)
```

- This way gets me the most, I struggle to keep track of what is happening
when reading from the inside out, and I waste loads of paper drawing
up pipelines like this to figure out what's the end goal of the pipeline
(sadly most other languages don't have the `%>%`)!

### The pipe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo <- little_bunny()
foo_foo %>% 
  hop(through = forest) %>% 
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>% 
  bop(on = head)
```

The authors remark that this is their favourite form, because it focusses on verbs, not nouns, and I am totally with them.

Foo foo hops through the forest, then scoops up field mice, then bops 'em on the
head.

Behind the scenes magrittr creates a function with these steps and 
saves each in an intermediate object for us.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_pipe <- function(.) {
  . <- hop(., through = forest)
  . <- scoop(., up = field_mice)
  bop(., on = head)
}
my_pipe(foo_foo)
```

The pipe does not work well for all functions though. Ones that
use the current environment, functions using lazy evaluation like
`tryCatch()`.

### Other useful pipe operators

Call a function for its side effects.

```{r}
rnorm(100) %>% 
  matrix(ncol = 2) %>% 
  plot() %>% 
  str()
```

Our `str()` did not produce anything! `r emo::ji("sad")`

Enter the __tee operator__ given by (%T>%). Things like `print()`, 
`plot()`, `View()` etc. do not return anything and when you use them
in a pipeline it pipes nothing into the next step in the pipeline. A pipeline
expects the result of the previous step to "replace" the first
argument in the subsequent step though so this breaks the pipeline.

The __%T>%__ does it's job and sends the result of the previous pipe
to the one after it's side job function.

```{r}
rnorm(100) %>% 
  matrix(ncol = 2) %T>% # side job is to please plot
  plot() %>% 
  str()
```

The above takes `matrix(rnorm(100, ncol = 2)` and pipes it into `str()`.
