## Workflow ...

<span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`object_name <- value`</span> can be read as "object name __gets__ value"

Find the `<-` tedious to enter? RStudio has a shortcut `Alt + -` to enter it for you.

Alternately there's the great {styler} package that you may use to convert your code to the preferred style.

1. Go to Tools -> Install Packages and install `styler`
1. Else go to the [Github page](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) to install.
1. In your code select the section you want to format (not necessary if you want to do for the entire file).

    * Go to Addins
    * STYLER
    * Choose `Style selection` or the option appropriate for your task.
