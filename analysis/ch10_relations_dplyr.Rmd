<h2>Main types of joins</h2>
## Main types of joins

* __Mutating joins__, which add new variables to one data frame from matching
  observations in another.

* __Filtering joins__, which filter observations from one data frame based on
  whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

* __Set operations__, which treat observations as if they were set elements.

### Dataset

These are the datasets we will be using to learn about __joins__ which come
from the _nycflights13_ package.

*   `airlines` lets you look up the full carrier name from its abbreviated
    code:

    ```{r}
    airlines
    ```

*   `airports` gives information about each airport, identified by the `faa`
    airport code:

    ```{r}
    airports
    ```

*   `planes` gives information about each plane, identified by its `tailnum`:

    ```{r}
    planes
    ```

*   `weather` gives the weather at each NYC airport for each hour:

    ```{r}
    weather
    ```
    
*   `flights` gives the flights departing a NYC airport:

    ```{r}
    flights
    ```

For nycflights13:

* `flights` connects to `planes` via a single variable, `tailnum`. 

* `flights` connects to `airlines` through the `carrier` variable.

* `flights` connects to `airports` in two ways: via the `origin` and
  `dest` variables.

* `flights` connects to `weather` via `origin` (the location), and
  `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` (the time).

### Exercises

1.  Imagine you wanted to draw (approximately) the route each plane flies from
    its origin to its destination. What variables would you need? What tables
    would you need to combine?
    
    We would need the origin and dest from `flights` and the lat and lon
    for each origin / dest from `airports`.

1.  I forgot to draw the relationship between `weather` and `airports`.
    What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?
    
    `weather` has origin, and `airports` has faa. These could be joined 
    to get all weather conditions for each day and each hour in the
    dataset.

1.  `weather` only contains information for the origin (NYC) airports. If
    it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional
    relation would it define with `flights`?
    
    There would be a relation with dest.

1.  We know that some days of the year are "special", and fewer people than
    usual fly on them. How might you represent that data as a data frame?
    What would be the primary keys of that table? How would it connect to the
    existing tables?
    
    I would have a table called `holidays` and it would have a 
    _year_, _month_ and _day_ variable that can be used to connect
    to flights, and weather.

<h2>Keys</h2>
## Keys 

* A table has a name, a column too has a name. 

* Rows however don't have names, and need a way to be identified. This is done
through a __primary key__. A primary key identifies a single row in a table. It
is unique since no two rows can have the same primary key. It may be simple (a single column serves as the primary key) or composite (multiple columns serve as the primary key). <br>
For example, `planes$tailnum` is a primary key because it uniquely identifies
each plane in the `planes` table.

* Data is spread among several columns. A __foreign key__ allows you to associate the different tables you have. A _foreign key_ is either a single column or
multiple columns that reference values in some other table.<br>
  For example, `flights$tailnum` is a foreign key because it appears in the 
  `flights` table where it matches each flight to a unique plane in the `planes`
  table.

* A variable can be both a primary key _and_ a foreign key. For example, `origin` is part of the `weather` primary key, and is also a foreign key for the `airports` table.

```{r findkey, include=FALSE}
airlines %>% 
  count(carrier) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

airports %>% 
  count(faa) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)  
  
weather %>% 
  filter(year == 2013,
         month == 11,
         day == 3,
         hour == 1) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

weather %>% 
  filter(year == 2013,
         month == 11,
         day == 3,
         hour == 1) %>% 
  mutate(lag = lag(time_hour),
         lead = lead(time_hour),
         diff = time_hour - lag) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
  

weather %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, origin, time_hour) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

weather %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, 
        origin, dest, carrier,
        tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)

# Let's have a look at a few
flights %>% 
  filter(year == 2013, month == 1, day == 7, hour == "6",
         origin == "LGA", dest == "ORD",
         carrier == "AA", tailnum == "N3CYAA") %>% 
  print(width = Inf)

flights %>% 
  count(year, month, day, hour, 
        origin, dest, carrier,
        tailnum, flight) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("findkey") %>% 
  flair("count", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080") %>% 
  flair("filter(n > 1)", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")  
```

When even a combination of columns does not seem to identify an observation
you may add your own primary key. The best is to use <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">__mutate__</span> with <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`row_number()`</span>. This is called a _surrogate key_.

### Exercises

1.  Add a surrogate key to `flights`.

    ```{r}
    (flights_pk <- flights %>% 
      mutate(pk = row_number())) %T>%
       print(width = Inf)
    ```


1.  Identify the keys in the following datasets

    a.  `Lahman::Batting`
        
        Wondering how to figure out what datasets are available to you to use?
        
        Call <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`data(package = 'XXX')`</span> to get a listing.
        
        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        data(package = "Lahman") %>% 
          print()
        
        ```
        
        The above produces a list like this `r emo::ji("down")`:
        
        <figure>
        <img src="assets/data_cmd.PNG" width="650" height="500" alt="Data in a package Lahman">
        <figcaption>data(package = 'name_of_pkg')</figcaption>
    
        </figure>
    
        <br>
    
        ```{r}
        data("Batting", package = "Lahman")
        # data("Salaries", package = "Lahman")
        # data("People", package = "Lahman")
      
        as_tibble(Batting) %>% 
        # first try
        count(playerID, yearID, teamID) %>% 
        filter(n > 1)
      
        as_tibble(Batting) %>%  
          # let's have a look at one to see what else
          # differentiates it
          filter(playerID == "alyeabr01",
                yearID == 1972,
                teamID == "OAK")
      
        as_tibble(Batting) %>% 
          count(playerID, yearID, teamID, stint) %>% 
          filter(n > 1)
        ```
        
        Looks like the key is `playerID`, `yearID`, `teamID` and `stint`.

    a.  `babynames::babynames`
    
        ```{r}
        data(babynames, package = "babynames")
        class(babynames)
        babynames
        babynames %>% 
          # n is in the columns so we need to name our variable
          # something else
          dplyr::count(year, sex, name,
                      name = "count",
          # without the wt = 1, it was using n as a weight in count                  
          # Using `n` as weighting variable
          # i Quiet this message with `wt = n` or count rows with `wt = 1`
                      wt = 1) %>% 
          filter(count > 1)
        
        babynames %>% 
          group_by(year, sex, name) %>% 
          summarise(nn = n())
        
        babynames %>% 
          # confirming there is only one row for each
          filter(year == 1880, 
                 sex == 'F',
                 name == 'Abby' | name == "Adda")
        ```
    
        Looks like the key is `year`, `sex`, `name`. So, we had some issues
        here, since the dataset had an `n` variable in it. The <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`count() / tally()`</span> function 
        uses `n` as a weighting variable.
    
        To fix this we need to:
    
        - explicitly name the output variable something other than `n`
        - add a `wt = 1` to not tally up the `n`.
    
        Let's see this with the example tribble in the help docs. 
    
        First as it should be:
    
        ```{r}
        # use the `wt` argument to perform a weighted count. This is useful
        # when the data has already been aggregated once
        (df <- tribble(
          ~name,    ~gender,   ~runs,
          "Max",    "male",       10,
          "Sandra", "female",      1,
          "Susan",  "female",      4
        ))
        # counts rows:
        df %>% count(gender)
        # counts runs:
        df %>% count(gender, wt = runs)
        ```
    
        Now let's rename `runs` to `n`, and we see the difference:
    
        ```{r}
        # use the `wt` argument to perform a weighted count. This is useful
        # when the data has already been aggregated once
        (df <- tribble(
          ~name,    ~gender,      ~n,
          "Max",    "male",       10,
          "Sandra", "female",      1,
          "Susan",  "female",      4
        ))
        # counts rows:
        df %>% count(gender) # weight(wt) = n implicit
        ```
    
        Adding a new name and a `wt = 1` we should get the original output 
        as when we used the variable named `runs`. Here it shows `female` as 1 
        which is not correct. `r emo::ji("horror")`
      
        ```{r}
        # use the `wt` argument to perform a weighted count. This is useful
        # when the data has already been aggregated once
        (df <- tribble(
          ~name,    ~gender,      ~n,
          "Max",    "male",       10,
          "Sandra", "female",      1,
          "Susan",  'female',      4
        ))
        # counts rows:
        df %>% count(gender, 
                     name = "count", 
                     wt = 1
                     )
        # counts n's:
        df %>% count(gender, name = "count", wt = n)
        ```
    
        I am <span style="color: #FFE4E1;background-color:#E3242B">unsure what is really going on above</span>, 
        as I expected `female = 2`, but I don't have time to investigate. 
        It does work for the `babynames` case so this may be some 
        other anomaly - maybe convert to a factor and see?
    
    
    a.  `nasaweather::atmos`
    
        ```{r}
        data("atmos", package = "nasaweather")
        
        atmos %>% 
          count(lat, long, year, month) %>% 
          filter(n > 1)
        ```
      
        Looks like the key is `lat`, `long`, `year` and `month`.
  
    a.  `fueleconomy::vehicles`
    
        ```{r}
        fueleconomy::vehicles %>% 
          count(id) %>% 
          filter(n > 1)
        ```
    
        Looks like the key is `id`.
    
    a.  `ggplot2::diamonds`
    
        ```{r}
        ggplot2::diamonds %>% 
          count(carat, cut, color, clarity, price, depth, table, x, y, z) %>% 
          filter(n > 1)
        ```
    
        There is not a clear key for diamonds so here we would create one using
        a surrogate key via a mutate and row_number().


1.  Draw a diagram illustrating the connections between the `Batting`,
    `People`, and `Salaries` tables in the Lahman package. Draw another diagram
    that shows the relationship between `People`, `Managers`, `AwardsManagers`.

    How would you characterise the relationship between the `Batting`,
    `Pitching`, and `Fielding` tables?
    
    ```{r}
    # the connections between the `Batting`, `People`, and `Salaries` 
    data('Batting', package = "Lahman")
    data('People', package = "Lahman")
    data('Salaries', package = "Lahman")
    
    Batting <- Batting %>% 
      as_tibble() 
    
    Batting %>% 
      head(15) %>% 
      DT::datatable()
    
    People <- People %>% 
      as_tibble() 
    
    People %>% 
      head(15) %>% 
      DT::datatable()  
    
    Batting %>% 
      # how many distinct "players"?
      distinct(playerID) %>% 
      nrow()
    
    People %>% 
      # how many distinct "people"?
      distinct(playerID) %>% 
      # ahh, notice num_people > num_players
      # this accounts for the managers etc. I believe
      nrow()
    
    Salaries <- Salaries %>% 
      as_tibble()
    
    Salaries %>% 
      head(15) %>% 
      DT::datatable()  
    
    Salaries %>% 
      # how many distinct "people" do we have salaries for?
      distinct(playerID) %>% 
      # ahh, notice we have very few salary records
      nrow()  
    ```

      DT::datatable()
    
    Lahman::fieldingLabels %>% 
      as_tibble() %>% 
      DT::datatable()
    ```

    I think these are complementary tables which all together make
    up the different aspects of the game of baseball, and the stats
    for each player.

<h2>Mutating joins</h2>
## Mutating joins

Just as `mutate()` adds new variables to a dataset <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">mutating joins</span> joins two datasets
and tags on the extra variables on the right.

- Tables are joined using <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">keys</span>.
- Additional variables are <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">copied over</span> 
from one table to another.

```{r}
(flights2 <- flights %>% 
   select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
)
```

Let's say we want to add the actual airline.

- Need to figure out where we would get this ... looking at our tables 
it seems `airlines` would be appropriate.
- Need to figure out which field we can use to join it to `flights` ...
looks like `carrier` will do.

```{r}
flights2 %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
flights2 %>% 
  # base R way
  mutate(name = airlines$name[match(carrier, airlines$carrier)]) %>% 
  print(width = Inf)
```

__Ok, let's create a few tables to see joins in action.__

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
  1,    "x1",
  2,    "x2",
  3,    "x3"
)

y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
  1,    "y1",
  2,    "y2",
  4,    "y3"
)
```

### Inner Join

- Only joins wherever <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">keys are equivalent</span>  (i.e. the key must be present in both tables).
- Unmatched rows are __not__ included in the result.
- I.e. we __lose__ observations.

```{r inner1, include=FALSE}
x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("inner1") %>% 
  flair("inner_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

_Observation_: key = 3 in table x is not kept, and key = 4 in table y
also falls away.

### Outer Joins

- `Left join` keeps all observations in x.
- `Right join` keeps all observations in y.
- `Full join` keeps all observations in x and y.
- Observations from __at least__ one table is kept.
- The most commonly used join is the __left join__. It looks up additional data from another table, and it preserves the original observations even when there isn't a match.

#### Left Join

```{r lj, include=FALSE}
x %>% 
  left_join(y, by = "key")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("lj") %>% 
  flair("left_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

#### Right Join

```{r rj, include=FALSE}
x %>% 
  right_join(y, by = "key")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("rj") %>% 
  flair("right_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```


#### Full Join

```{r fj, include=FALSE}
x %>% 
  full_join(y, by = "key")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("fj") %>% 
  flair("full_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

### Duplicate Keys

Sometimes the keys are not unique.

1.  One table has duplicate keys - there is typically a one-to-many
    relationship.
    
     <figure>
    <img src="assets/join-one-to-many.PNG" width="300" height="150" alt="One to many">
      <figcaption><span style="color: #6d6875;background-color:#e5989b">One to many</span></figcaption>
    </figure>

    <br>

    ```{r dupkey1, include=FALSE}
    x <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_x,
      1,    "x1",
      2,    "x2",
      2,    "x3",
      1,    "x4"
    )
    
    y <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_y,
      1,    "y1",
      2,    "y2"
    )
    
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    decorate("dupkey1") %>% 
      flair("left_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
            color = "#008080")
    ```
    
    Notice that:
    
    - The result has _two_ `key == 1`, and _two_ `key == 2`. 
    - I.e. the observations from `x`, the `left table`, is preserved.

1.  Both tables have duplicate keys. When you join tables with
    duplicated keys, you get all possible combinations, 
    called the <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">Cartesian product</span>.
    
         <figure>
    <img src="assets/join-many-to-many.PNG" width="480" height="300" alt="Many to many">
      <figcaption><span style="color: #6d6875;background-color:#e5989b">Many to many</span></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <br>
    
    
    ```{r}
    x <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_x,
         1,  "x1",
         2,  "x2",
         2,  "x3",
         1,  "x4"
    )

    y <- tribble(
      ~key, ~val_y,
         1, "y1",
         2, "y2",
         2, "y3",
         3, "y4"
    )
    
    left_join(x, y, by = "key")
    ```
    
    Notice that we have _two_ `key == 2` in table `x` and _two_ `key == 2` 
    in table `y`. That means that both the `key == 2` in `x` matches both the 
    `key == 2` in `y` resulting in __4__ entries in the resulting table.


<h2>Defining Key Columns</h2>
## Defining Key Columns

We've been lucky so far that the __key__ column in both tables we are joining
is called _key_. That's not usually the case, and tables often have 
composite keys (keys made up of several columns). 

- The default joining happens using 
<span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`by = NULL`</span>, which uses all variables that appear in both tables.
For example, the flights and weather tables match on their common variables:
`year`, `month`, `day`, `hour` and `origin`.

    ```{r, message = TRUE}
    flights2 %>% 
      left_join(weather)
    ```
- <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">A character vector</span> as we have been using thus far, <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`by = "x"`</span>. 
This uses some of the common variables. 
For example, `flights` and `planes` have `year` variables, but they mean different things so we only want to join by `tailnum`. The variable
which is named the same `year` but which mean completely different things in
each table, is uniquely named in the output by adding a `.x` and `.y` at the 
end of its name.

    ```{r, message=TRUE}
    flights2 %>% 
      left_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    ```

- A <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">named character vector</span>: `by = c("a" = "b")`. This will
    match variable `a` in table `x` to variable `b` in table `y`. 

    For example, to draw a map we need to combine the flights data
    with the airports data which contains the geographical coordinates
    (`lat` and `lon`) of the airport. 
    Each flight has an origin and destination `airport`, so we
    need to specify which one we want to join to.

    ```{r lj_diff, include = FALSE}
    flights2 %>% 
      left_join(airports, c('dest' = 'faa')) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    
    flights2 %>% 
      left_join(airports, c('origin' = 'faa')) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    ```
    
    ```{r, echo=FALSE}
    decorate("lj_diff") %>% 
      flair("c('dest' = 'faa')", background = "#9FDDBA", 
            color = "#008080") %>% 
      flair("c('origin' = 'faa')", background = "#9FDDBA", 
            color = "#008080")
    ```

### Exercises

1.  Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the `airports`
    data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here's an
    easy way to draw a map of the United States:

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    airports %>%
      semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point() +
        coord_quickmap()
    ```

    (Don't worry if you don't understand what `semi_join()` does --- you'll
    learn about it next.)

    You might want to use the `size` or `colour` of the points to display
    the average delay for each airport.
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      group_by(dest) %>% 
      summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      inner_join(airports, c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat, colour = mean_delay)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point() +
        coord_quickmap() +
        scale_colour_viridis_b()
    ```
    

1.  Add the location of the origin _and_ destination (i.e. the `lat` and `lon`)
    to `flights`.
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      left_join(airports, by = c("origin" = "faa")) %>% 
      left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
      print(width = Inf)
    ```
    

1.  Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

    Let's have a look at the total delay, i.e. considering the departure 
    and arrival delays.

    ```{r}
    (flights_sub <- flights %>% 
       # get subset of fields
       select(year:day, dep_delay, arr_delay, origin, dest,
              tailnum))
    
    flights_sub %>% 
      # join on tailnum
      inner_join(planes, by = ("tailnum" = "tailnum")) %>% 
      # subset data again from the planes tbl
      select(dep_delay, arr_delay, origin, dest,
             tailnum, year.x, year.y,type, manufacturer) %>% 
      # need stats for a plane, so group by tailnum the
      # unique id for a plane
      group_by(tailnum) %>% 
      # add variables to calc age of plane
      # and various delay stats
      mutate(age_plane_in_2013 = year.x - year.y,
             mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
             mean_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE),
             tot_delay = mean_dep_delay + mean_arr_delay) %>% 
      # we only care about planes where delay exists
      # and where we know the planes age
      filter(tot_delay > 0,
             age_plane_in_2013 > 0) %>% 
      select(tailnum, year = year.y, age_plane_in_2013, type, manufacturer,
             mean_dep_delay, mean_arr_delay, tot_delay) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      ggplot(aes(x = age_plane_in_2013, y = tot_delay)) +
      geom_col()
    
    ```
    
    The planes delay increases as the plane ages, but starts decreasing
    around age = 12, and drops further past that age. Perhaps the 
    maintenance cycle gets more rigourous as the plane ages? `r emo::ji("shrug")`

1.  What weather conditions make it more likely to see a delay?

    ```{r}
    
    flights %>% 
      select("year", "month", "day", "origin", "hour", "time_hour",
             "dep_delay") %>% 
      inner_join(weather) %>% 
      group_by(origin, year, month, day, hour) %>% 
      mutate(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      ungroup() %>% 
      filter(avg_dep_delay > 0) %>% 
      select("year", "month", "day", "origin", "hour", 
             "avg_dep_delay", "temp":"visib") %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      arrange(-avg_dep_delay) %>% 
      # slice_head(n = 10) %>% 
      # print(width = Inf) %>% 
      pivot_longer(cols = "temp":"visib",
                   names_to = "type",
                   values_to = "measure") %>% 
      ggplot(aes(y = avg_dep_delay, x = measure)) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
      facet_wrap(~ type, scales = "free_x") 
    ```

    It seems that the higher the dewp and humidity (and to some degree
    temp) the higher the delay. The visibility in miles also seems to increase
    the departure delay.
    
    The precipitation seems to decrease the delay which is a bit strange for me,
    I was under the impression that would lead to longer delays. 


1.  What happened on June 13 2013? Display the spatial pattern of delays,
    and then use Google to cross-reference with the weather.

    ```{r}
    worst <- filter(flights, !is.na(dep_time), month == 6, day == 13)
    worst %>%
      group_by(dest) %>%
      summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay), n = n()) %>%
      filter(n > 5) %>%
      inner_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%
      ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
        borders("state") +
        geom_point(aes(size = n, colour = delay)) +
        coord_quickmap()
    ```
    
    It seems there was [intense storms](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/capital-weather-gang/wp/2013/06/14/june-13-2013-severe-weather-hypestorm-or-the-real-deal/) on June 13th, 2013.
    

### Other ways

`base::merge()` can perform all four types of mutating join:

dplyr              | merge
-------------------|-------------------------------------------
`inner_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y)`
`left_join(x, y)`  | `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE)`
`right_join(x, y)` | `merge(x, y, all.y = TRUE)`,
`full_join(x, y)`  | `merge(x, y, all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)`

Pros for {dplyr}:

- Easier to understand what the code is doing, 
- Translates better to SQL (which is a language by the way, and not an acronym - found out from `SQL: Visual QuickStart Guide, by Chris Fehily`,
- Is _faster_, and
- Does not mess with row order.

SQL translation

dplyr                        | SQL
-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------
`inner_join(x, y, by = "z")` | `SELECT * FROM x INNER JOIN y USING (z)`
`left_join(x, y, by = "z")`  | `SELECT * FROM x LEFT OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`
`right_join(x, y, by = "z")` | `SELECT * FROM x RIGHT OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`
`full_join(x, y, by = "z")`  | `SELECT * FROM x FULL OUTER JOIN y USING (z)`

Joining different variables between the tables, e.g. `inner_join(x, y, by = c("a" = "b"))` uses a slightly different syntax in SQL: <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`SELECT * FROM x INNER JOIN y ON x.a = y.b`</span>.


<h2>Filtering Joins</h2>
## Filtering Joins

* <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`semi_join(x, y)`</span>:
    __keeps__ all observations in x with a corresponding observation
    in y. Semi-joins are useful for matching filtered summary tables back to the original tbl. 
    
    You can think of `semi_join(x, y)` as observations in x asking each observation in y - "Hey, yoohoo, over there, for the columns we have in common, do you 
    also have the same values in those columns as I do?"
    
    * if yes (doppelgänger found), x observation kept
    
    * if no (no doppelgänger found), x observation dropped
    
    * Keep __ONLY__ the observations of me you can find in y
  
* <span style="color: #008080;background-color:#9FDDBA">`anti_join(x, y)`</span>:
   __drops__ all observations in `x` that have a match in `y`. I.e. it 
   keeps the rows that _don't_ have a match.
   
   You can think of `anti_join(x, y)` as observations in x asking each
   observation in y the same question as above, but taking the opposite action! 
  
    * if yes (doppelgänger found), x observation __dropped__ [I want to be
    unique!]
    
    * if no (doppelgänger not found), x observation __retained__ [Yay, I'm the
    only one]
    
    * Keeps __ONLY__ Unique entries of me

```{r}
(top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(10))
```

Now to find flights that went to one of those destinations you could construct a filter yourself ...

```{r}
flights %>% 
  filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)
```    

But this gets tricky if you have multiple columns you're summarising
something for.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  semi_join(top_dest)
```

How many flights don't have a match in `plane`?


```{r anti, include=FALSE}
flights %>% 
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
decorate("anti") %>% 
  flair("anti_join", background = "#9FDDBA", 
        color = "#008080")
```

### Exercises

1.  What does it mean for a flight to have a missing `tailnum`? What do the
    tail numbers that don't have a matching record in `planes` have in common?
    (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      filter(is.na(tailnum),
             is.na(dep_time),
             is.na(dep_delay),
             is.na(arr_time),
             is.na(arr_delay))
    ```
    
    The flights that were cancelled seem to be the ones with missing `tailnum`.

    What about those that have a tailnum but we don't have an entry for it
    in planes?
    
    ```{r}
    (missing_planes <- flights %>% 
      anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
      count(tailnum, sort = TRUE))
    
    flights %>% 
      filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>% 
      semi_join(missing_planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
      select(tailnum, carrier) %>% 
      left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% 
      count(carrier, name, sort = TRUE) 
    
    planes %>% 
       filter(stringr::str_detect(tailnum, "MQ")|
              stringr::str_detect(tailnum, "AA"))
    
    (carrier_missing <- airlines %>% 
      filter(carrier == "MQ" | carrier == "AA"))
      
    ```
    
    These seem to be mostly for carriers `r carrier_missing$carrier`, which
    are `r carrier_missing$name`.
    

1.  Filter flights to only show flights with planes that have flown at least 100
    flights.
    
    ```{r}
    (flights_100 <- flights %>% 
       filter(!is.na(tailnum)) %>% 
       select(tailnum) %>% 
       add_count(tailnum) %>% 
       filter(n >= 100)
    )
    
    flights %>% 
      semi_join(flights_100)
    ```
    

1.  Combine `fueleconomy::vehicles` and `fueleconomy::common` to find only the
    records for the most common models.
    
    ```{r}
    fueleconomy::common %>% 
      left_join(fueleconomy::vehicles,
                by = c("make"="make", "model"="model"))
    ```
    

1.  Find the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst
    delays. Cross-reference it with the `weather` data. Can you see any
    patterns?
    
    I am going to assume that the question just wants the top 48 hours that 
    constitute the worst delays, and not the worst consecutive 48 hour 
    block of time.
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      group_by(year, month, day, hour, origin) %>% 
      summarise(mean_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
      # ungroup removes grouping - without this we get weird
      # results! Try it with and without to see diff.
      ungroup() %>% 
      arrange(-mean_dep_delay) %>% 
      slice_head(n = 48) %>% 
      left_join(weather) %>% 
      pivot_longer(cols = temp:visib,
                   names_to = "type",
                   values_to = "measure") %>% 
      ggplot(aes(y = mean_dep_delay, x = measure )) +
        geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
        facet_wrap(~ type, scales = "free_x")
    ```
    
    If we look at the `Defining Key Columns` under question 4, we see that these
    flights with the top delays have humidity in the higher humidity range we saw
    overall, and same for temperature.


1.  What does `anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))` tell you?
    What does `anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))` tell you?

    ```{r}
    anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
    
    anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
      distinct(dest)
    
    anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))
    
    airports %>% 
      distinct(tz)
    ```
    
    `anti_join(flights, airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))` gives us any
    flights where the destination does not exist in airports.
  
    If you google the airport names you will see that most flight destinations
    that are not in `airports` are located in Puerto Rico, or US Virgin Islands.
    Perhaps these were not in the FAA listing of airports when this data 
    was extracted? Because the wiki pages for these show that the FAA code is
    the same as we see here.
    
    `anti_join(airports, flights, by = c("faa" = "dest"))` gives us airports
    that don't exist in flights. These will be destinations that are not
    flown to directing from New York.

1.  You might expect that there's an implicit relationship between plane
    and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm
    or reject this hypothesis using the tools you've learned above.
    
    Ok so what would we believe here? I would suspect that a plane belongs
    to a single airline. But some counters to this view is that surely 
    planes can be bought and sold between carriers. 
    The question would be in that case would the plane change `tailnum`?
    
    Working on the first assumption what sort of join would help me
    determine if a plane belongs to one airline?
    
    I would do a `left_join(planes, flights, by = "tailnum")` and then get 
    the carrier(s) per plane, and join with airlines. 
    
    ```{r}
    flights %>% 
      select(tailnum, carrier) %>% 
      distinct() %>% 
      left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>% 
      inner_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>% 
      count(tailnum, carrier) %>% 
      filter(n > 1)
    ```

### Tips for joins

1. Determine the primary key
1. Check that none of the primary key variables are NULL
1. Check that foreign keys match primary keys in other tables.
1. Don't just rely on counts before and after joins! These can
be misleading.
