I almost always work in projects now.

Recently thanks to a hosting opportunity for useR!2020 I also learnt about {workflowr} created by John Blischak, Peter Carbonetto and Matthew Stephens. The R package {workflowr} facilitates reproducible research, and works great with GitHub once you setup your RStudio environment to talk to GitHub.

### {workflowr} Commands

- install.packages("workflowr")
- library(workflowr)
- Configure Git: 

  > wflow_git_config(user.name = "Your Name",
                    user.email = "email@domain")
                     
    * Only need to do this once on a computer if you use
    the same GitHub account for all your work.
    * I use different GitHub accounts so I sometimes
    need to redo this command based on the Git profile I am using.
<br>    
-  Start Project (Existing Project):

    > wflow_start(directory = ".",
                name = "Analysis XXX",
                existing = TRUE)
              
- Start a New {workflowr} Project from scratch:

      <figcaption>File -> New Project -> New Directory -> scroll to `workflowr project`</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
-  Build Website

    The site will be built from the `.Rmd` files in your `analysis` folder.
    
    > wflow_build()
    
- If you're converting an existing project into a {workflowr} project 
move your `.Rmd` files into the `analysis` folder, move your data 
into the `data` folder, and move any images into some sub-folder (you can name
as you wish I believe - I use `assets`) in the `docs` folder.

- If you are starting a new {workflowr} project, and don't yet
have any analysis files, once you do create `.Rmd` files save these in the
`analysis` folder.
  
- Add the `.html` link(s) in index.Rmd. For example:

  `[Chapter 1:  Data Viz with ggplot](ch1_ggplot.html)` <br>

- Publish website (this builds the website and does a `git commit`):
  
  <pre>
    wflow_publish(c("analysis/*.Rmd", 
                    "data/*.csv",
                    "docs/assets/*.*"),
                  message = "Add analysis")
  </pre>
              
- Create repo on GitHub (only need to do this once).

- Connect the repo on GitHub to the {workflowr} project (only need to do
this once).
  <pre>
      wflow_git_remote("origin",
                        user = "<github-username>",
                        repo = "workflowr-analysis")
  </pre>   
  
- Push project to GitHub

  > wflow_git_push()
  
### {workflowr} Common Commands

After you have setup your {workflowr} project and
you're working on your analysis these are the commands that
you will typically use in a solo project.

        c("analysis/*.Rmd",

        message = "Some more specific message than this ;)"
