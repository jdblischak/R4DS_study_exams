```{r setup, include=FALSE}

I almost always work in projects now.

Recently thanks to a hosting opportunity for useR!2020 I also learnt about {workflowr} created by John Blischak, Peter Carbonetto and Matthew Stephens. The R package {workflowr} facilitates reproducible research, and works great with GitHub once you setup your RStudio environment to talk to GitHub.
